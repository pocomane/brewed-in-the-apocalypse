# Brewed in the Apocalypse

This is a role playing game for 3-6 player. One person will play as the
"Scenarist", while the others will play the "Protagonists".

To play, you need 2 standard 6-sides dice (2 for each protagonist would be better),
some white sheets, a pencil and eraser (a pencil for each player would be
better).

TODO list:

- Rewrite the examples addressing the Character, not the Player
- Some setting playbook must be added.
- Some examples must be written.
- The content must be made more concise in various point.
- All the english text must be revised.
- The final sections (marked as very preliminary draft) have to be rewritten from
  scratch.

In this manual we use the Spivak pronouns ey/em/eir/emself for genre neutral
third person singular. A more common alternative would be the singular they but
we found that it adds confusion in lot of sentences.

TODO : security rule (but do not call it security rule)

TODO : a protagonist can tell anything happened in the past to eir character ?

# Setup

Before the first session starts, a scenarist is designed and a setting playbook
is selected all together. It contains the setting, characters and initial
scene of the game, and maybe additional rules. We will call it just "Playbook".
You can use one included in this manual, or an external one.

In the rest we will consider that the players choose a
standard playbook, with all ready to start playing.  If this limitation seem
too strong, you can refer to the "Your World" playbook included with this
manual (practically it helps you to create an original playbook). You can mix
it also with other playbook, e.g. using it only to generate new characters for
another selected playbook.

The playbook contains a short description of the setting; the scenarist should
read them to the protagonists.  The setting should have been kept compact by
purpose: the rest should be defined and discovered during the play. However
some setting may have more lore details, presented at the very beginning as
prose paragraphs.

Make sure that all the players, have pencils and some
white sheets of paper to take notes about anything. This is particular
important for the scenarist to be sure to remember how the important things are
connected, however these notes have no effects in the mechanics or the fiction.
The game status that instead have such effects, is kept in the "Protagonist
sheet" managed by each protagonist.

Then each protagonist will chose one character from the playbook, and they will copy
all the information on their character sheet. Like the setting, the characters
are described by few sentences, to leave the space for the protagonist to add new
details during the game. The playbook contains also the initial goals of the
characters, and a description of the initial scene. This is meant just kickoff
the game, new goals can be selected as soon as the protagonists found something more
interesting.

We will use the term "Protagonist" for both the players and their controlled
player; where this make confusion we will use the term "Protagonist player" for
the player, and "Controlled character" or "Protagonist character" or PC for the
character. Similarly, all the characters in the game that are not controlled by
a protagonist, are called "Non protagonist character" or NPC. The term s
"Controlling player" instead can refer both to a protagonist player when
addressed to a PC, or the scenarist when addressed to a NPC.

In the character sheet there are three type of information relevant both for
the fiction and the mechanics; each of them is in the form of one or few words
describing an aspect or a state of the character:

- The Traits (preceded by +) are what the character does well, and gives em a
  mechanical bonus on rolls
- The Harms (preceded by -) are negative status that gives mechanical malus on
  rolls
- The Tags (preceded by #) describes other status that does not have effect on
  rolls effect but should be considered in the fiction, or may have additional
  mechanics as described in the playbook

The symbols before this items are there to quickly distinguish them to other
things  in character sheet that should just be considered a note without any
mechanical or fictional consequence.  It may be useful to separate each kind of
element in a dedicated list but always keep the described symbols.

In the rest of the manual, we can ask to count, add or remove multiple
identical copy of some of that information. This is just to keep simple the
treatment, you are encouraged to indicate multiply identical copy placing a
number near it, increasing and decreasing it as needed.

# Playing the game

The game is like a conversation. The protagonists contribute describing what
their PC do, asking questions, and speaking in character. The scenarist
describes the scene, the actions of the NPC and what is happening in the game
world.  Sometime the
rules of the game will prescribes to do something else to make the story go
ahead, like dice roll, or asking questions to the people in the real world.

We call "Fiction" all what happen in the story, while "Mechanics" are all the
things that the players need to perform in the real world, and that
have some consequences in the fiction.

Sometimes the scenarist will highlight that something said by a protagonist is
untrue or unreasonable, suggesting alternatives.  The scenarist should consider
all the in-fiction details about the setting, the character and the
situation, to decide if something is reasonable or not. Someones refers to this
saying that such details give a "Fictional positioning" to the character.

```
Probably to cast fireball you have just to be a Mage.  Or in some setting
being a Mage is not enough: you need a wand too. And if in the previous scene
you did lost it, you can not cast it. These are purely consideration about the
fiction, there is no mechanics, maybe just a note on a sheete to remember that
the wand was lost.
```

To describe the interactions between the people playing to this game, we use
the concept of "Move". A move has a title written __like this__ and can be a
protagonist move or a scenarist move. In any case it is just a rule containing a
trigger text and a result text.

The trigger prescribes when the rule will come into play, while the result
defines what the people can than add to the fiction, and what is needed to do
mechanically, if something. One of the possible results is to move the
discussion between the persons around the table.

The players must perform what the result text demands when it
is triggered. They can not decide to skip the result if triggered, and can not
obtain the results until the trigger happened.

the responsibility of check the triggering of a move is of everyone; anyone can
say "You triggered that move"; naturally every player will look more to the
moves that ey can trigger; however, if the protagonists did not know the game
very well, we suggest to the scenarist to pay attention to other moves too
(the scenarist MUST know the game very well in any case).

TODO : return to: It is a scenarist responsibility to check if a move is triggered,
and communicate it to the other protagonist, and to ask for the specific action to be
performed, if any. If a protagonist did not really wanted to trigger the move, the
scenarist should leave to em the opportunity to rollback and to said something
else.

To gain confidence with the concept of move, we here review some moves that
probably could be completely omitted as obvious them are. The first one:

__Describe the scene__ when you have to start the session, you can resume the
last scene or an older one, or start a completely new one.  You do it telling
some new event in the scene or reveal some new truth about the
world. Nothing should clearly bring to troubles for the protagonists, neither if it
is completely ignored by the characters.  However, there may be an opportunity
for the protagonists: something that can bring to good things for the protagonists if
they handle well the situation.  Occasionally the good things may happen
without any protagonist action.

TODO : describe what a "Scene" is, what it means it is "Suspended" or "closed" ???

"When ... session" is the trigger, so the rest, the result text, must be done
at the beginning of a session. Note that since this is a scenarist move, "You"
in the text is the scenarist. Here the move just said that the scenarist can
say anything ey like about the fiction, until there are no imminent threats for
the protagonists. How the discussion is moved to the others? We have the following
scenarist move:

__Ask what they do__ - when you are speaking and you have nothing
else to say, ask to one ore more characters in the current scene what they do
next.

```
Scenarist: Nick try to escape from the backdoor. What do you do?

Bob: I block him.

Scenarist: Ho do you do it? I mean, you hold him physically, or you stand in
front of the door, or what else?

Bob: Oh yes, I mean just cutting of his exit, I place myself between him and
the door.
```

So at end of the __Describe the scene__ , when the scenarist has nothing more
to say, just conclude with "What do you do" ? Then here there is the first
protagonist move:

__Tell what the character does__ - when the scenarist asks what your character
does, you tell your character actions, what ey says, feels, etc. You do it also
when the scenarist asks it to a group your character is member of, no one is
still speaking, and you find out something interesting to tell.  If there is
something not clear in scene or that you think is interesting to know about,
ask it to the scenarist. Ask also if your actions bring you to a new situation
you want to know about. If the scenarist explicitly asked you for some
particular detail, first give it in the most concise way you can found, than
you can elaborate it.

Here, since it is a protagonist move, "you" just means "the protagonist". So the protagonist
have to reply to the "What do you do" telling the action of eir character. There
is also an option to ask more details, so how you can easily guess now, there
is this other move for the scenarist:

__Describe some details__ when a protagonist asks to you to better describe some
details about the current scene, just do it, unless ey is asking for something
eir character is not supposed to know, see or understand. In such cases just
said "You do not know".

Note that when the scenarist ends the __Describe some details__ move, it is
triggered again the __Ask what they do__ , and so on.  As already said, these
are trivial moves, more advanced one may contain fiction clues, or some
mechanical things to to, as we will see.

To conclude with the obvious things: the moves did not regulate all the
discussion. If someone want to speak of something outside the fiction, and it
do not annoy anyone at the table, ey can just do it. Also if ey want to give
suggestion on how the fiction should go, ey can do it without having a move to
explicitly allowing it.  Also some information about the fiction the may be
revealed (probably by the scenarist) during this non-regulated discussion.  But
all of this should be considered to be hypothetical until some move makes
them happen or reveal them true in the fiction.

# Hosting the game

The scenarist have a crucial role in the creation of the story, so ey
should follow some sort of guidelines to be sure the experience be somehow
consistent.  The long term goal of the scenarist is in the following Agendas:

- Play to find out what happens.
- Describe a world that make sense.
- Make the PC lives not boring.

TODO : explain them !!!

The first is particular important. The scenarist, is a player to, in the sense
that ey participates to the game to discover what happen, and what the other
people will do.  The preparation of big portions of materials is discouraged.
An interesting prompt from a protagonist should never be ignored to let the story
follow some predetermined track, unless it is temporary, just to close some
matter already almost done. For the same reason, the setting should be kept
initially simple.  More details about the world and the backstory will be
discovered during the play, defined by the actions of all the players.

Moreover, early in the first session (but for some setting these can
extend to the whole game), the scenarist should also juggle two additional,
sometimes conflicting, responsibilities:

- Follow the PCs around, and learn what they are all about.
- Give the protagonist a sense of what the world is like, and how it operates.

During the game, whatever the scenarist said should follow the following
Principles:

- Do not play against the protagonists, rather be a fan of their characters: the
  challenges are not introduced to destroy the characters, but to make they shine.
- Respect the world you are creating; do not tell incoherent events; a
  destructive challenge may be introduced because the situation does not make
  otherwise sense.
- Be honest with the protagonists: do not withhold information that their
  character should know, make sure the situation is clear to them, let them
  behave differently if there was some misunderstanding, etc.
- With your moves, try to continually push the game forward in interesting
  ways; new opportunities should be added when a protagonist succeeds in a move, and
  interesting dilemma should emerge from the twists.
- Respond to the character actions with challenging circumstances and
  occasional rewards.
- Name everyone and everything, and call all by name; particularly address
  yourself to the characters, not ther controller player.
- Make your move, but misdirect and never speak its name; you have not to hide
  what moves you are doing, but present it as naturally arising from the
  fiction.
- Create interesting dilemmas, not interesting plots.
- Think off screen, too.

TODO : Add more detail to the last two (and find the right position in the list) !!!

TODO : make a move to let the protagonist to create part of the world !

# Common move mechanics

TODO: split the section in small parts and move them somewhere else ?? Something
may bacame a new move ?

Some moves share common mechanics that would be noisy to explain every times,
so we describe them once here.

Until now we saw move with trigger in the real world, but it is very common,
particularly for protagonist moves, to have a move triggered when something happened
in the fiction.

If a move says to trigger another move, skip the trigger condition of the new
one, and execute the rest of the text. This is a second way every move can be
triggered.  When the trigger text just repeat the title of a move, this means
that the move is not triggered directly be some action in the fiction, but come
into play only when another move explicitly asks for it.

TODO : add the page reference when referring to a move so that the move description
can be quickly found ???

```
The __Make the worst happen__ says to make an __Assign an harm__. The
latter just says "When you have to assign an harm..." as trigger text, so
it is designed to be called from other moves only.  This trigger text, like any
other that would be in this situation, is ignored. Just continue reading the
rest: ... ask to the target ...
```

Some moves do not imply the time pass in the fiction. If there are some imminent
deadline, such moves should not be use as justification to let the characters
miss the deadline. If the characters are speaking to each other, deciding what
to do, this may let the time pass.

```
Scenarist - your hat falls down and the rock wall is quickly descending, what
do you do?

Bob - I do not understand, is Bart outside the temple, and is the hat still
inside?

Scenarist - Yes, however the time is over, so the wall closes...

Bob - wait, wait, you were just doing a __Describe some details__ move, there
was no action involving. The time can not pass!

Scenarist - Yes, sorry, you are right. So, what do you do?
```

In general the protagonists can not repeat the same move again and again searching
for best results. The core check mechanics already discourages this since every
non-optimal result gives the scenarist the chance to add some trouble for the
protagonist. However the scenarist should clearly state that it would not result in
a new roll, since there is no reason that something different happens. The
scenarist should actually allow another roll only if it is the fiction itself
that demands for a repetitive action.

```
Bob - I failed before, but I want try to sway her again.

Scenarist - There is nothing changed in the situation, she will still refuse,
without a need for a roll.
```

```
Alice - I try to hit him again, I hope to kill him this time

Scenarist - Yes, you already wounded his neck, so if you are successful probably
you will kill him. Make a roll.
```

Some moves makes the protagonists ask questions to the scenarist. Sometimes ey
already knows the answer, but ey can always change eir mind. After it is
answered, that become absolutely true in the fiction and the characters will
know the answer.

Such moves gives to the protagonists a list of questions to choose from.  If they
ask something not in the list, the scenarist should still give any details the
character can know, as the __Describe some details__ prescribed.  Then the
scenarist should highlight that the question is not one in the list, so the
protagonists can still ask one of them.

```
The group is in a wild region, and the scenarist has not decided yet if they
will encounter some beast or a rival faction preparing an ambush. As consequence
of a move, Alice asks:

Alice - How many enemy outposts are there?

Scenarist - None, there are no obstacles to your sight, except some tall grass,
so if there was some outposts you would see them. However this question is not in
the list, I just said what you see, so you can still ask me something in the
list".

Alice - Which is the biggest threat in the area?

Scenarist - There is something moving in the grass, at 20-25 meters. It passes
for one moment in a zone with a more sparse vegetation and your character can
recognize it: is a big feline. It did not mind you, for now...
```

Some other moves differs if the target is a PC or an NPC, they are presented as
different moves with PC/NPC in the title.

```
Bob: Bart shots to Nick.

Scenarist: He can not... look on your character sheet: he does not have a gun
anymore since he loose it in the previous scene. But you have a rusty knife, if
you want you can make a roll to try to wound him with it.

Bob agrees to use the knife, than rolls the dices and got a twist.

Scenarist: ok, you hurt him, but since the knife is very rusty it breaks, delete
it from the character sheet.
```

# Handle the uncertain - scenarist move

Most of the move are presented in the relative sections for the scenarist and
the protagonists; however we want discuss in this dedicated section a scenarist
move that is central for all the game, and quite articulate. Note that the
__Taking action__ protagonist move simply prescribes a new trigger for this
move, using its default outcomes only.

__Handle the uncertain__ when a protagonist move with the "If you have to roll"
prescription is triggered, you perform the following steps in order:

1. Decide if you can skip the roll.
2. Let the protagonist roll with the right modifier.
3. Wait the protagonist does what the move demands.
4. Tell the consequences.

This kind of moves represent character actions whose consequences have some degree
of uncertainty. This can be because they may generate complications, or because
they are difficult do accomplish and so may fail.  Let's see the various steps.

First, sometimes the uncertain can be ignored, and so you can skip the rest of
the move. The most simple reason for this is that an action is actually simple
to accomplish or very likely to be successful considering fictional
positioning.  In this case you can decide it is a success and skip the second
step.  Do the same if the consequences of a failure are not interesting at all.

```
Bob: Bart want to go upstairs, this is __Taking Action__, do I have to make a check?

Scenarist: No, he is healthy, neither tired, he can not fail!
```

```
Bob - Bart is going to drink the glass of water, but he have a hand wounds, it
is a __Taking Action__, and it may fails, so I have to make a check?

Scenarist: well, also if he fails, I do not see any interesting consequences...
so just continue, Bart is successful.
```

Similarly, if an action is too much likely to fail, the scenarist should just
said it is impossible. If the protagonist insist to do it, just decide it is a failure
and skip the second step.  This "Impossibility" veto must be used judiciously
and sparingly.

If the protagonist just continues to speak, skipping or performing a roll contrary
to what the scenarist thinks is appropriate, the scenarist can stop the action,
point out what the protagonist should do.

```
Alice: Anne is angry, she want to break the wall with a punch. I use the
traits: Big, strong...

Scenarist: Wait, I do not think that's possible in this setting, Anne is
not a superhero. But she could instead kick at the door. She has good chances to
break it.

Alice: No, she is too angry to think, so she will punch the wall in any case!

Scenarist: Ok, she fails, and she break her hand, record the harm in the character
sheet please.
```

If you decide to keep the the second step, it is the core "Roll". You briefly
describes the risks of the situation, and you select the character harms that
are the relevant for the situation.  Then you ask to the protagonist which are the
relevant trait and how many Fortune point to spend, between 0 and 2 .  The
traits represent ability of the character, while the harms negative status, and
the fortune point is a bonus carryed from previous action; they all are
described in the protagonist move section.

Then the protagonist rolls 2 standard 6-side dices, sums the results, adds the
number of traits and fortune points and subtracts the harms.  The result will
say which kind of outcome the character will get:

- With 8 or less  the protagonist get a "Failure" outcome.
- With 9-10-11    the protagonist get a "Twist" outcome.
- With 12 or more the protagonist get a "Success" outcome.

TODO - return to classic ranges ? classically in a Apocalypse World
the three ranges are 6-/7-8-9/10+ but
it has the 5 statistics going from -3 to +3 - The starting sum 3 (in mean) 35%
fal, 22% suc - the improvement let to add till 5 (in mean) 0%fal, 87% succ - in
BITA instead you can not go under 0 traits, there are harms, and normally at beginning
is common to use 1-2-3 traits for all the roll

There are no constraints on which trait the protagonist may select, but after a
success the scenarist may, and is encouraged to, select one of the used trait.
The protagonist must tell how that trait helped em to success. If ey is unable to do
it, the roll became a failure.

TODO : on failure, the protagonist can select an harm and the scenarist show how it
make the action fail ???

Normally, with the 8 initial traits, in every roll you would be able to play 1
or 2 of them, unless the protagonist is forced to make an action that is completely
out of the character.  4 or more traits are played instead during actions for
which the character have a very good fit. Obviously, in the late game these
number can increase consistently.

In the third step, if the move contains a text for the selected outcome (both
the roll one, or the one forced by the scenarist), it is read and what it
demands is done.  A missing text means that the specific outcome does not
change the situation.

```
Bob - Bart look at the motorcycle engine to understand the problem and to fix
it.

Scenarist - Ok, here the issue is knowing how an engine works to understand,
what do not touch, and what to touch to fix it. Roll for it.

Bob - I will use the traits Intelligent, Smart and Quick understanding, so I have a
bonus of 3

Scenarist - yes, but you have a "Mental stress" harm of 1, so you can add only 2 to
your roll

Bob - Ok. I got 10. So the result is 12, a success.

Scenarist - So Bart quickly understand that the fuel pump was detached, and he
easily put it in place.
```

In the forth and last step, you can add some details that makes the scene
evolve ( the __Make the worst happen__ and __Tell imminent troubles__ moves are
described in the section about the other scenarist moves):

- On success, if no outcome text is present or if the situation is not evolved
  enough, make a __Describe the scene__ move with something good for the
  protagonist; it should give to the protagonist what ey want from the action, if any.
- On twist, if no outcome text is present or if the situation is not evolved
  enough, select one item from the twist option list.
- On a failure, after the execution of a failure text if any, always make
  a __Make the worst happen__ .

Twist option list:

- Do what the failure text demands, if any, then do a __Describe the scene__
  move with something good for the protagonist; if not failure text is present, the
  character simply does not get what ey want, but just what was established in
  the __Describe the scene__ .
- Do what the success text demands, if any, then do a __Tell imminent troubles__
  targeting the character of that protagonist, or a group ey is member of.
- Ask to the protagonist if for em is ok to get a success, but having you making
  a __Make the worst happen__ ; to convince em you can give more or less details
  about what it will happen. If the protagonist refuse, select another option,
  from this list.

```
Scenarist - Bob, you got a twist. Bart quickly understand that the
fuel pump was detached. He can easily put it in place, but since all the part
are still very hot, he will be wounded. You agree, or I will found something else?

Bob - No, Bart already have a lot of harms.

Scenarist - Ok, let's say you are successful anyway. You attach the pump avoiding
the hot parts. But to do it you have to concentrate very much, and you do not
notice a bikers who stopped, and now is just behind you. He places an hand
on your shoulder and turns you toward him, what do you do?
```

# Other scenarist moves

__Rollback__ - When you think the protagonist should stop telling for any reason,
let em finish instead, or wait that a move is triggered, then, if you still
think it is necessary, rollback to the critical point and explain why you
restart from there. Not interrupting the description let you to fully understand
what the protagonist want to to, and often you will found that there is no reason to
rollback at all.

You are allowd to interrupt only when two or more protagonists start to speak one
over another; in such case stop them, summarize the situation so far and ask to
a single protagonist what ey does.

Moreover, it may happen that a protagonist is making a long description of events
that you already know you have to rollback. In general, also in such cases the
right thing to do is to wait ey to finish; however you are allowed to interrupt
the protagonist if you make it in order to not waste the protagonist time, and after you
explainded your reasons you give them the possibility to continue eir
description.

Typically, you have to make a rollback when:

- the protagonist is telling something impossible.
- the protagonist misunderstood something in the scene.
- the protagonist is too vague about the precise actions of the character, and you
  want em to add more details in order to decide which are the consequences and
  if some moves are triggered, as well as to decide which traits/harms/tags are
  involved.
- the protagonist gives a vague description of what is needed by other moves (like the
  __Taking an advantage__ move), and, again, you need em to add such details.

In case you have to completely delete something the protagonist told (e.g. the first
two previews points), always give em a similar alternative.

The rollback can not go over a previous move: you already had the possibility
to make a rollback exactly when the move was triggered.

TODO : merge with the __Ask what they do__ move !!!!

```
Scenarist - You managed to enter in the Nick head quarter. You are hidden
behind a pillar. There is a guard doing the patrol, to the other side of the
room there is the only door, clearly locked. What do you do?
Bob - I stunt the guard, then I will use my crowbar to force the door lock, and
I quickly go out closing the door behind me.
Scenarist - Ok, you are trying to quickly go out before someone else come in, I
understand it, but to stunt the guard I think you need to roll. So let's
rollback to that point, can you explain exactly how you try to do it?
Bob - Ok, I wait him to pass my hiding place, then go behind him and hit him
with my crowbar.
```

```
Scenarist - You managed to enter in the Nick head quarter. You are hidden
behind a pillar. There is a guard doing the patrol, to the other side of the
room there is the only door, clearly locked. What do you do?
Bob - I stunt the guard, then I will follow the room perimeter looking for
trap, in the meanwhile, I search for storage box, and...  ... after a couple of
minutes ...
Bob - ... moreover I will continue to tighten the bandages...
Scenarist - Ok, sorry, I have to stop you. If you want you can continue with
all this description, but I will anticipate you that we have in any case to
rollback to the guard stunting. You need a roll for it, and you did not give us
too much detail to decide which the consequences could be.
```

__Ask to the protagonist__ - when you are speaking and you think it is appropiate,
make a question to one or more protagonist, and build on theri answer in your
narration.  Ideally, you should continuously asking such question.  You may
also About the questions them self: 

They may be provocative to push a reaction

```
They are after you, do you prepare yourself in some way?
```

They may be informative to get some prompt to elaborate

```
You found a truck, or do you think motorcycles are more appropriate?
```

They may be a direct request to to create a small part of the story or the
world (very appropriate when the character is supposed to know the situation)

```
Bart, you are an ex-soldier, how is this barracks made?
```

They may also be just a way to give color to the situation

```
how your character is dressed?
```

__Tell imminent troubles__ - when you asked to all the protagonists in the scene
what they do, and if they stop after a while without triggering any move, add
to the scene something that give to the protagonist new things to react to.  You can
introduce such complication playing as an NPC.

You can use the same clues of the __Make the worst happen__ , but do not make
them irrevocable, leave instead to the protagonists the possibility to react.

If you think the situation is already complex, you can do a __Describe the
scene__ move instead.

TODO - is this enough to handle "Make an __Make the worst happen__ when the
protagonists hand you the perfect opportunity on a golden plate." (together with
roll failure) ???

```
Scenarist - you reach the gate, there are three guards watching it, they are
well equipped. What do you do?

The protagonists starts to talk a little, but they do not have any ideas, so they
look at the scenarist

Scenarist - Ok, it is a bit suspicious that you are all there doing nothing, so
one guard leave his position, and slowly approaches to you, looking visibly
concerned.  What do you do?
```

```
The characters are in a bus out of control. They starts to propose each outer
possible things to do, but no one take an action.

Scenarist - Ok, the time is out: the bus go off road. It crash on a wall.
Fortunately it was not so fast, so you did not get serious injuries. But
obviously now you need to find another way to reach your destination.
```

__Assign an harm__ - when you have to assign an harm, chose one or few words
that represent physical injuries, mental stress, or any other negative
condition that make sense for the setting; the target protagonist adds such harm to
eir character sheet.  Obviously the chosen harm must follow by the fiction, ant
they will cause effects in the fiction.

The harms may never be used to give a bonus to an action. If it would help the
protagonists to reach their goals, it is simply ignored.

The harms can be removed when something related happen in the fiction, as
explained in the __Remove an harm__ move.

__Make the worst happen__ when the characters ignore a problematic
situation for too much time or when they give you the perfect opportunity, you
can do one of two from the following list

- Do an __Assign an harm__ move
- Add something in the scene that fundamentally changes the situation, for the
  worse. What you add must be irrevocable, i.e. the protagonist can not avoid it
  reacting in any way, and the new situation should demands new kind of actions
  to the characters. This can be an event, a character, an object, or simply
  new informations.

You should skip the latter, only when there are already too much problematic
events to handle in the fiction. The consequences of a
previous __Tell imminent troubles__ are a perfect example of "Problematic
situation".

TODO - explain better "too much time" ??? explain better "perfect opportunity" ?

Here there are some clues:

- Separate them.
- Put them together.
- Capture someone.
- Put someone in a spot or in a high-stakes situation.
- Take away something from them.
- Exploit the bad side of something they have.
- Turn their move back on them.
- Reveal an inconvenient truth
- Give them a difficult decision to make.
- Offer an opportunity, with or without a cost. ???
- Tell them the requirement and the possible consequences, then ask. ???
- Announce in-scene badness. ???
- Announce off-screen badness. ???

```
TODO : add an example
```

__Make the characters evolve__ - When it is a calm situation and a quest ended,
or something important for the plot happened, or when a lot of time passed
without this move was triggered, you ask ALL the protagonist to trigger __Add a trait__ ,
When all finished, __Describe a scene__ .

TODO : merge __Add a trait__ with the previous move ?

```
Scenarist - Ok, Bart you got a success. Not only you manage to hit the man that
killed your family, but due to your rage and brutal behavior, he is thrown down
from the tower. You hear a scream, a thud, and nothing else.  This is an
important step in the story, so all the protagonists can add a trait or a special
move to eir character sheet. Try to make them coherent with how they feels
after this umpteenth murdered.
```

__Change a tag__ - when the status of a character changes in a way that may
affect the mechanics or the fiction in the future, and it is not already
highlighted by a trait or an harm, ask to the protagonist to change a tag on the
character sheet.  A tag is one or few words that have effects in the fiction, and
potentially in the mechanics, e.g.:

- A status, ability, skill, vantage, disadvantage, illness, incapacity, etc, that
  does not follow the mechanics of the traits or the harms, but can still
  contribute to the fictional positioning of the character, or may have other
  mechanics described in the playbook.
- An object owned and carried on by the character.
- A knowledge that can be used in specific circumstances by the character.

Optionally a tag may have a number associated to indicate the quantity or the
strength of the status.  Changing a tag means adding or removing it You decide
how the tag is changed based on what happened in the fiction.

```
Scenarist - The Eleven Sage blesses Anne. Now her can understand and read, but
not speak or write in it, the language of the elves. Alice, write the tag
"Understand elven language" on the character sheet.
```

# protagonist moves

TODO : add a move to recall memories ?

The most basic move that allows interaction is "Taking Action": it is a sort of
fallback for uncertain situations not covered by other moves. Practically you
can play also with this move alone deleting any other one requiring a roll, but
other moves will bring colors to the game.

__Taking Action__ - When you take an action that risks failure or
complications, there is no other more specific move, and you have to roll, do
what the standard outcomes demand in the "Handle the uncertain" section.

```
Alice - Anne will wait that the librarian go away the deck then she will take
the book.

Scenarist - Ok, you need a roll to be sure to not be noticed.

Alice - Yes, I will use the traits Agile and Fast... and I got a success.

Scenarist - Ok, a colleague comes to chat with the librarian, and they slowly
walk to the coffee machine. When they are quite far away, Anne go behind the
deck and take the book without no one noticing her.  Alice, what Anne does
next?
```

Normally, the scenarist decides if a NPC fails or is successful in taking any
action. However the protagonists may influence the outcome if the following moves
are triggered.

__Helping NPCs__ - When you help someone and you have to roll:

- On success, that person is successful
- On failure, that person fails. Only one character can help a NPCc, but other
  may help or hinder you

__Hindering NPCs__ - When you hinder someone and you have to roll:

- On success, that person fails
- On failure, that person is successful. Only one character can hinder a NPCc, but
  other may help or hinder you

```
Scenarist - Nick understand what are you doing here, and escape from the front
door, then...

Bob - Wait, Bart was near him, so he put himself in front of the door.

Scenarist - Ok, but Nick is fast, please make a roll

Bob - ok, but I do not have any useful traits, so I will not add any bonus... and
I got a failure!

Scenarist - So Nick successfully escape from the door, and pushes Bart, that fall
down hurting is shoulder on the door frame. Sign "Shoulder pain 1", as harm.
```

__Helping PCs__ - When you help someone and you have to roll. You can not
help someone helping or hindering an PC.  If multiple character are helping,
add only the maximum value.

- On success, add 2 from the next roll of the PCs.
- On twist, add 1 from the next roll of the PCs.

__Hindering PCs__ - When you hinder someone and you have to roll:

- On success, subtract 2 from the next roll of the PCs.
- On twist, subtract 1 from the next roll of the PCs.
 
The __Hinder PCs__ can be done also when that person is acting against you
directly (this is the way to represent an opposition roll). You can not hinder
someone helping or hindering an PC.  If multiple character are hindering,
subtract only the maximum value.

```
Alice - Anne is not agree, so she tries to establish herself. For safety she tries
first to take the gun from the Bart's holster.

Bob - Well I think Bart will see her coming, so he is ready to hold the gun.

Scenarist - Yes I think too, Bob make a roll to hinder Anne.

Bob - ok, the intelligent, smart, and quick understanding will help Bart to known
beforehand what Alice is doing... and I got a success!

Scenarist - ok, you oppose effectively to Anne, now Alice make a roll with a -2
malus

Alice - ok, I have one relevant traits. I got 7, plus one, -2, then 6.

Scenarist - Well, so Alice reaches the gun but Bart have a good holding and
pushes her away. Alice does not get hurt but the others did not approve her
behaviour: write on her sheet Betray 1
```

In the following moves, it would be great if the __Make the worst happen__ that
the scenarist will do after a failure roll were liked to the question just
asked. 

__Read a person__ - When in a charged situation you try to get some
information from a person and you have to roll:

- On Success ask the controlling player 3 question from the list
- On Twist ask the controlling player 1 question from the list
- On Failure ask the controlling player 1 question from the list

Questions about the person (the protagonist have to fill the _ before to ask):

- Is your character telling the truth? 
- What’s your character really feeling? 
- What does your character intend to do
- What does your character wish I’d do? 
- How could I get your character to _ ?

__Asses the situation__ - When you read a charged situation and you have to roll:

- On Success ask to the scenarist 3 questions from the list
- On Twist ask to the scenarist 1 question from the list
- On Failure ask to the scenarist 1 question from the list

Questions about the situation (the protagonist have to fill the _ before to ask):

- How could we best end quickly?
- Which enemy is most vulnerable to me? 
- Which enemy is the biggest threat? 
- What should I be on the lookout for? 
- What’s my enemy’s true position? 
- Who’s in control here? 
- What here I can use to _ ?

An example of these moves are already given in the core mechanics sections.

__Sway a NPC__ - When you try to convince someone leveraging something, and you
have to roll, you tell what you want them to do, you give them a reason, then:

- On Success, they’ll go along with you, unless or until some fact or action
  betrays the reason you gave them.
- On Twist, they’ll go along with you, but they need some concrete
  assurance, corroboration, or evidence first.

This move applies also when you tray to manipulate, bluff, fast-talk, lie or
threaten with the violence someone.

```
Bob - I ask Nick to open the door and let us to enter. Can I roll?

Scenarist - Well, you are not using nothing to sway him. You are just
asking.

Bob - Ok, Bart says "Hey Nick, are you not tired to work for Rick ? Let me enter
I have a job for your, a very interesting one.

Scenarist - ok make a roll

Bob - I use the Intelligent and Smart trait; 6, plus 2, 8 then

Scenarist - Nick says "A job? I am expensive, Bart, too much for you

Bob - Bart opens the carry case, putting all the money in front of the peephole
```

__Sway a PC__ - When you try to convince someone leveraging something, and you
have to roll, you tell what you want them to do, you give them a reason, then:

- On Success the other protagonist have to choose to get a reward and do what you
  want, or get penalty and refusing to do it
- On Twist you decided if to offer the reward alone or the penalty alone,
  then the other protagonist chooses what to do

This move applies also when you tray to manipulate, bluff, fast-talk, lie or
threaten with the violence someone. The reward and the penalty are:

- If the other protagonist refuse, the scenarist will __Assign an harm__ to em
- If the other protagonist accept, then ey can __Add a fortune point__ two times

```
The situation is the same of the __Sway a NPC__ example, but behind
the doors there is Anne, the Alice's character. After the roll:

Scenarist - Ok, you got a twist from the roll, you can decide one consequence
of the Alice decision.  Harm or Fortune points ?

Bob - I will say, that if she agree, she will get two fortune points.

Scenarist - Ok, Alice what you do?

Alice - Anne opens the door and says "I hope you have something more a vague
promise of a job...
```

 __Taking an advantages__ - when you are doing something to make a future
action more simple or probable to succeed, explicitly said what action or kind
of actions you are trying to favor, and you have to roll.
- On Success the scenarist will ask you do __Change a tag__ to the value 2; the
  tag will describe the frame in which it is valid; until it is each roll you make
  will take a +2 bonus; the scenarist will ask you do __Change a tag__ to 0 when
  it is no more appliable.

Note: if the advantage is very circumscribed in time, you may avoid to write it
and just remember it.

```
Alice - Anne tries to go on the roof, to get a better view of the situation. In
this way we can get some advantages on check about shooting, or escaping.

Scenarist - ok, there are enemies keeping the house under control, so make a roll.

Alice - Anne uses the traits "Agile" and "Silent"... and I got a success!

Scenarist - ok, so you reach the root, what the others do?

Alice - Wait... Should I write something like "Sight from the roof 2" on my
character sheet? So we can remember that any action for which it is an advantage
will give me a +2 bonus on the roll!

Scenarist - Yes, you should, and if you want, just do it. But the bonus is
valid only until you are on the roof, so I think we can remember it also
without having to write the tag! I will inform you in any case when the bonus
ends.
```

__Remove an harm__ - when you make some action that can cure or treat some
status associated to one or more harm, the scenarist will tell you which
harms can be potentially removed. If you are not satisfy, you can tell some
other action the character does instead. If you are satisfied and you have to roll:

- On Success, delete up to 3 related harms
- On Twist, delete up to 2 related harms
- On Fail, delete one related harms

__Remove a temporary harm__ - when enough time is passed for a temporary
harm to be heal, ask to the scenarist, if ey agree, you can remove it. Any
harm can be temporary if the scenarist decide it can heal on its own over time.
You can ask in any moment to the scenarist if an harm is temporary.

```
Alice - Anne take Bart on her shoulder and tries to reach the back door.

Scenarist - ok, make a roll.

Alice - I have 2 relevant traits... and I got a failure! So, I think I can not
reach it.

Scenarist - No, and you also get wound. You already have one, so change it to
Wound 2.

Alice - Ok, but I think that Anne has demonstrated to all the group that she
care about them; I should remove the "Betray 1" harm.

Scenarist - I fully agree, remove it!
```

__Add a fortune point__ - when you have to add a fortune point, increase by
1 the number of fortune point on the character sheet. If you already have
6 fortune points or more, you do not increment it.

The fortune point can be spent to give you a mechanical bonus to your future
rolls.

TODO : remove the fortune points ?

__Add a trait__ - when you have to add a trait, add into the trait section of
your character sheet one or few words that describe a quality, an ability, or a
tendency of the character. If the character had more than 16 traits, one must
be deleted first.  The new trait that must be linked to other two already in
the character sheet, unless it is one of the first 4 of the character.  All the
trait ever written on a character sheet must be different each other.

The traits will give you a mechanical bonus to any roll when acting according
to the traits. They should also describe how the character acts in the fiction,
however two traits may be quite opposite, resulting in a character acting
against one of them while trying to respect the other.  This is perfectly ok:
the character have multiple faces and did not have to act always at same way.
Note that a trait can generate negative effect in the fiction, but it can never
be used to give a malus during a roll.  Also if it has negative acceptation, it
will enter in play only if it is useful for the goals, otherwise it will be
simply ignored.  You can invent completely new traits, just be sure that all
the other persons at the table are agree on using them.

```
Bob chose the first four traits of his character to be "Smart", "Intelligent"
"Robotics enthusiast" and "Drives anything with an engine".
```

Each protagonist freely select the traits of eir character, but we suggest to
discuss with all the others to make them not too much generic or specific.
Moreover consider that strong stress in a single trait does not means that it
will give you a strong bonus, just, maybe, that it will be used in a lot of
situations. And a trait that is always used is not fun to play.

If you really want a strong bonus in some areas, consider to put similar traits
that will probably always be used together.

The "link" constrain is here just to write traits that are somehow coherent. It
does not came in play in no way.  The other obvious constraint for any trait is
that it respect the spirit of the setting and the tone of the play.

```
After the first four traits, Bob want to add "Perfect" likning it with "Smart"
and "Intelligent"

Alice notes that "Perfect" is too much generic, and also if put in play, it
will not means that the character will be perfectly successful. She propose to
change it with "Understand quickly" if he ment it as a boost for the previous
intellectual traits; also because just linking does not have such mechanical
effect.

Bob agrees, and adds "Understand quickly" as a traits linked to "Smart" and
"Intelligent"
```

# Represent the difficulty

There is no mechanic way to represent actions that need the same traits to be
accomplished, but have different level of difficulty or risky consequences. In
other world, if the protagonist selects the same traits for two rolls, they have
have the same probability to be successful, and the same probability to
generate complication.

However the scenarist can represent the difficulty of an action at least in two
ways, that may be combined.

When an action is difficult because it can generate serious problems, the
scenarist may just generate more serious consequences. In extreme cases, the
scenarist may point it out to the protagonists, asking if they are sure to continue,
increasing the tension.  If the protagonist agrees and the result is a failure,
the __Make the worst happen__ may be very very hard. Multiple harms, dying,
quests forever closed, etc. Also the twist branch could be very bad.

```
Bob - Bart pulls out the guns...

Scenarist - hey, wait wait. If you want you can continue, but I want to be clear,
if you will have to roll for what you are doing (and probably you will), and you
got a failure, I have to be very very bad. I mean, you are in front of a war lord
and two of his trusted henchman, Bart could also die in such situation...

Bob - ok, ok, Bart, already has the hands on the guns, but then he cool down,
make a laugh, and said "Oh, come on guys, we have a deal!"
```

If the action instead is difficult meaning that the chance are very low, but
still the scenarist want to give a possibility to the protagonist, ey can
point out that the action can not be accomplished by a single roll, but the
protagonist must perform two or more of them. It will be successful only if all the
rolls are successful or twists, and every twist will throw in a cost to
pay.  Just one fail and the whole sequence is a fail.

The chain roll, as anything else, must be justified in the fiction. Often this
means that the scenarist should give a lot of details about the danger of a
situation, so that each step of the chain is there so overcome one danger.  All
the details should be known by the protagonists before they have the chance to make
difficult actions, so the scenarist should continuously add such details in every
situation ey think the risks are high.

TODO : If ey forgot, ey can add it in a second moment, before the roll, giving
to the protagonist the possibility to rollback and do something else. !!! NOTE this may
rollback over other moves!!! It worth ????

Fleast but not last, each step of the chain should ask the protagonist for different
action respect the other steps.

```
Alice - Anne tries to blind the dragon with her sword.

Scenarist - You are forgetting the flame and its height. To do it you have first to
go close to him avoiding the flame, than you have to climb on the dragon's back.
Then you have to reach the head without falling down. Than you have to hit
the eye, maybe multiple times. They are at least 4 rolls, if anyone is a
failure you have to restart... and obviously you can get harms, loose weapons,
etc, at every stage. Obviously this is just a suggestion, maybe you can find a
better plan.

Alice - Actually I like it. OK, LET'S START.
```

# Adapt the system to your games

The game system is mainly composed of three parts:

- The mechanical rules for resolve the rolls, with traits and harms
- The scenarist moves for handling of the session
- All the other moves

The last one make sense only if both the first two point are used, so it does
not make sense to adapt it to other systems. Maybe you can just take inspiration,
but it strongly depends on what effect you want to achieve, so there are no
hint here.

To use the mechanics with other way of being a GM (the Game Master, that is
what the Scenarist is after all), just ignore anything about the scenarist or
protagonist moves the, GM will tell when make a roll, which traits are relevant, when
delete an harm, etc. according to the target system.

Instead, to use the Scenarist system with other mechanics, map the check in
that system to the three outcome Success, Failure and twist. For example, in a
d20 system you can see a roll equal to the threshold +/- 2 to be a twist,
higher is a Success, lower a failure. The only other thing you have to decide
is what to do instead of giving an harm or a change a tag, but probably your
system still have a way to handle the status changes (that is what the harms
and tags are after all). Just remember that when the scenarist have to change a
tag, ey can also consume or assign new objects to the protagonist, since in the
original game the tags were used to that purpose too.

If you have a critic success or fail system you have to add some Scenarist move
like "On critical success, give award" and "On critical fail, make the __Make
the worst happen__ still worse". Again, this depend too much on the target
game, so no ready recipe here neither.

# Master less or Master full

THIS SECTION IS IN A VERY PRELIMINARY STAGE, AND NEEDS A LOT OF TESTING.

A master less version is being developed. In it there is no a single scenarist,
but eir role is divided by all the protagonist. So probably a better name
would be "Masterfull".

The basic idea is that the scenarist moves are avaiable to all the protagonists, and
when the scenarist should act, the first protagonist that pay a Scenarist Token can
act as the scenarist. The Scenarist Token are collected every time your
character make a roll (a protagonist can have maximum 5 scenarist token).

# Your World - Playbook

This is not an actual setting playbook. You can see it more like a
procedure and some adivice to create your own setting. Since it is a bit
articulated, it is organized in sub-section.

THIS PLAYBOOK IS IN A VERY PRELIMINARY STAGE

## Create the Scenario

To create the scenario by you own, take a sheet to record the details about the
abmientation.  First select all togheter an overal setting, like "Stempunk",
"Fantasy", "Contemoporary", "7 seas advetures", etc.  Then by turn each person
at the table writes on the sheet one thing that ey does not want to see in the
play.  Here we are not speaking of vetoing stong themes or similar, but just
personal preferences. You can also discuss on what adding, if changing
something already written, or add more constraints.

By turn a person will ask a question about the world. The other will answer
with a sentence as short as ey can, trying to make it enough different from the
other ones. Then discuss all togheter on each answer, why it is interesting, if
there is some incoherence, etc.  During the discussion an answer may be
modified or expanded, if the proposer agrees.  At the end the person that asked
the question, select an answer, and ey writes it on the setting sheet. The
only constraint is that can not be selected an answer that would make the
setting sheet incoherent.

When you have a dozen of sentence, this phase can be concluded. Them, togheter
with the list of the forbiddend themes, are all what you need to start to play,
the rest of the world will be discovered and defined during the play.

Now you should agree on the tone of the play. There is no mechanical system
here, just try to agree if the tone would be serious, realistic, light-hearted,
dark, funny, crazy, or whatever. To make the thing more clear, the protagonists and
the scenarist may make concrete examples of what can happen, to understand if it
is ok for the others.

After the character creation, the scenarist will explicetely tell that all the
charactes known each other, someone better, someone lower. Moreover all the
character are somehow all togheter, in a travel, living togheter, or something
like that.

After the presentation the scenarist will ask to each character one of the
following question. When all the protagonist answered to one question, the scenarist
will do a second round of question. At end, each protagonist will respond to two
different questions:

- Who of the other character do you better know, and how?
- Who of the other character let you go angry, and why?
- Who you share a secret with, and which one?
- What do you think is the wrost thing in this world?
- What or who you're willing to take risks for?
- Where do you leave at the beginning of the story?

The answer may be also not fully detailed, leving the fully exploration of the
question to the actual game.

The scope of the questions is to define the initial scenario, and hopefully let
the group found the first mission that will kiffoff the game. All the important
aspects emerged dutring the presentation shoud be breiefly recorded on the
relative character sheet

TODO : add a full example of scenario creation ?

## Quick character creation

bla bla

For a quick version, the protagonists can just write on their
character sheetS 8 traits and 2 fortune points.  These can be seen as applying
8 times the move __Add a trait__ and 2 times __Add a fortune point__ , refer to
the relevant section for details. We suggest to start selecting and mixing
traits from the characters in in the playbook. Or at least use them
as inspiration.

## Creating special moves

Every time you have to __Add a trait__ you can do a  __Add a special move__ instead.

TODO : better explain the previous sentence.

All the character have the following additional move

__Add a special move__ when you have to add a special move, the scenarist will
show you a list of moves. Choose one that is not already on your character sheet
and add it to the character sheet.  If the character had more than 6 special
moves, one must be deleted first. The scenarist may ask you to customize the move.

The move list is provided in the playbook, however if the
scenarist or the protagonist want to create completely new ones, they may use the
suggestion in the "Your World" playbook, also if another playbook
was selected. In any case, the move should be created before the session to not
interrupt the game.

bla bla

The scenarist may invent a list of new moves to present to the protagonists when
they decides to __Add a special move__ . When the protagonists become comfortable
with them, the scenarist may start proposing moves that contains small
customization to be made by the protagonists. Finally, the creation of fully new
moves can be left to the advanced protagonists.

In any case Is an scenarist esponsability to balance the new rules so that they
are fun to play, so the final text of each move must be approved by em before a
protagonist could add it to eir character sheet.

In general, once a move is approved, it should became avaiable for any protagonist
to be added to eir sheet. However, exceptionally, when makes sense in the
fiction some move can be made avaiable only to a restrict set of protagonists, but
they all should agree on this before the move is added the very first time to a
character sheet.

The rest of this section contains advices on the move creation, and thing to
be care of. They are not strict rules, since occasionally braking these
guidelines may result in good moves too.

The most simple way to create a new move is just add two or three option to an
already avaiable move. It will pratically replace the old version.

```
__Asses the situation__: when you have to __Asses the situation__ , the following
options are avaiable too, other than the original ones

- What here is the greatest/least _ ?
- What here has been hidden or overlooked?
- What is the likely previous/upcoming situation?
 
The protagonist may fill the _ before writing the moves on the character sheet.
```

The general schema of new moves with rolls is "When [trigger text] then ask to
roll; on success [succes text]; on twist [compormise text]; on failure
[failure text].". Here there are some consideration about the various part.

The trigger text should not be too much specific or general, while at least the
success text should give something that the protagonist can not be sure to obtain
in other way. This trasforms the moves into small pushes for the protagonist to
perform certain action (the trigger) in the fiction, in order to get a sort
of known reward (the result texts).

TODO : rewrite the following paragraph

Moreover the result text needs to have creative clue to make the situation
change: a success/twist text that just said "You did it" should be avoid.
The __Tell the consequences__ is a sort of safety net to let the story go on,
but a move that relay on such mechanism only, by itself it is a bad dedigned
move.  In this sense the success text of the basic __Taking action__ move is
exactly what you should NOT do in a good move. That move is like that just
because it needs to be a fallback for cases where not other moves are avaiable.

For the moves that can be customized, or created, on the fly, try to make the
customization derive from the last actions of the character in the fiction.

```
Alice liked the situations where Anne was able to stole things whitout being
noticed, so when asked to make the character evolve, propose the following
move to the scenarist:

__Steal from a personal area__: when you are trying to steal something from a
personal area of somebody, and you have to roll:
- On success, you take what you want and the scenarist will tell how you
  discovery something important about the person you are robbering.
- On Twist, you did not get what you want, but you still discover
  something important.
```

Two good schemas to follow for the result text, is giving a list of clues to
follow in the fiction, and having the protagonist select a certain number of them.
The scenarist will expand the clues, but ey is constraint to follow them. If
the clues are positive for the protagonists, the success text will let the protagonist
choose more clues than the other outcome. If instead they are negative, the
failure text will require to select the major number of them. A mixed move
may be created, giving two lists, one bad and one good, and letting the protagonist
choosing from one or another based on the kind of result.

```
__Feel the engine__ when the character put the hand on the chassis of veicle with
the engine powered, and ey have to roll: 2 (on success) or 1 (on twist or
failure) question from the list. The scenarist will respond to them.

- Will this veichle be able to reach _ ?
- Have this veichle chance of go faster than _ ?
- What is a easy way to  sabotage this vehicle ?
- What is the fair value of this vehicle ?
```

Another kind of moves are the ones that in the result text mostly performs
mechanical action like modifing harms, giving fortune point, etc. You can create
such moves if you want to easly push the protagonists in acting according to the
trigger. But do not exaggerate with these ones since they will not evolve the
fiction very much, unless you found a good trigger that can feed the story by
itself.

You can directly refers to other moves in the result text; these kind of moves
enstabilishes common ways to perform actions.

```
__Drink blood__ when you drink the blood from the veins of a living person, you
can __Remove an harm__ related to a physical wound or stress.
```

All this means that the characters may ending having different special moves other
than the common ones shared by all of them. This may suggest that having a move
enable somehow the character to perform some action. This is not the case. If a
character may or may not perform an action is prescribed only by their traits,
harms and tags, and from the circumstances in the fiction.  If a character can
do something, when ey do it, the move is triggered.  Different set of moves is
introduced only to differentiate the outcomes per protagonist.

```
Bob - ok in this setting there is a move triggered "When you try to
cast a fireball...", so I try to cast one to hurt the troll, moving the hand in
the air...

Scenarist - No, no wait, the move is there to say what normally happens when
casting a fireball, but you have to be a Red Mage to cast a fireball. You are
an Archer, so if you want you can just throw an arrow...

# Future on Earth - Playbook

TODO : finish this playbook (HIGH PRIORITY) THIS IS JUST A RAW DRAFT

Earth 2100, or a similar planet with a similar evolution level. During the 21th
century big companies started having more and more power, ending to engulf the
biggest nations. However they have no interest in manage large portion of the
territory, so they concentrate the population and the production in huge
self-sufficient cities over witch they reign.

The commercial exchanges, and in general people mobing between different
megacities, are present but very reduced. Mainly, each megacity is the world of
the people who live there.  The technology level of the megacities may vary,
but it can be anything from the 2020s on earth, to something with pervasive
connectivity, cyber grafts, and light genetic improvements.

Outside the cities there are small settlements, or wandering group of people,
that practically live in a post-apocalyptic world, with scarcity of resource
and wild threats. The main reason to live here is because the policy of the
near megacities do not let you go in, and you do not have resource to reach
another one that could accept you. Citizens passes from there only during
travels between megacities, or because they have a temporary, probably
criminal, business to handle.

Outside, at most you can found some village that found a way to have
electricity, but any more advanced technology is stolen from some megacity and
probably will bring problems. Termomechanical vehicles are present, and may be
properly maintained, but the fuel must be obtained somehow from the megacities.
Very far from any megacities there are some isolated settlement that does not
known there are other people on the earth.

One of the biggest megacities is Babylon, with about 30M citizen and 15k
kilometers square. Since its a very high population density, the people lives
in lot of skyscraper, with the highest floors linked with small suspension bridges.
Most of the bridges are connected each other, forming a metropolitan web,
suspended in the void.

The city is governed by a board of three corporations. Vulcan-corp is sensible
smaller than the others, and do not have the dominance in any field; it tries
to do a bit of all, and this let it to pervade the city. Ares-corp and
Hermes-corp are more or less similar in size, but they mostly have the monopoly
in one field, and do near nothing about the rest: Ares-corp handle the security
in all the city, and have a strong military force; Hermes-corp control all the
communications and information. The other corporation are also smaller than
Vulcano-cop, and can have some influence on some specific political aspect, but
the have always to be supported by a member of the board.

The dispute between the three main megacorp are handled without any violence,
by bargaining, since any member of the board could report any incorrect
behavior to HR, High Referee, an AI the sole scope is to referee such
contention. It may block the resource of any of the parties, if it deems it
right and necessary. This is one of the requisite to become part of the board:
provide HR with the codes that give it that power.

The middle class in Babylon have a supervision job in the production or the
administration of the smaller departments of a corporation. The one with
technical skills may be able to work in the R&D department of them. However the
most of the people lives by gimmicks, probably illegal. The only legal job for
such people would be as worker in a production plant, for that few things that
still are not doable automatically by the machines. The high rank of the
corporation lives in luxury and only care about how gain more power.

The main entertainment form, both for criminals or ordinary people, are leisure
venues, that normally offers music, alcohols and drugs.

The criminality is widespread, and tolerated by the corporations until it does
not produces loss to them. The courts and prisons are there just to give an
appearance of security to the peoples, and to punish the enemies of the
corporations, obviously. The corporation would not hesitate to hire a criminal
if they found it would be useful to their goals. Or doing criminal act by them
own, whitout annoy the memebers of the board. The bast way to retaliate for
some wrong, is pay an agency, criminal or legal, (or a megacorp dirctly if you
have enough money) to handle the situation.

The corporation in the security field, mostly provides military forces, and
some system of judgment and punishment (in agreement with all the other in the
field) but for detective jobs they prefers to relay on external agency. The
smaller detective agencies offers service to the ordinary people too, and a job
from a megacorp is a coveted one. The agency must be registered to some
megacorp to have more freedom of action and to have the possibility to deliver
evidence and criminals to them.

The social situation is very tense. There are very frequent riots against
megacorp or their specific activities. This is also why the Hermes-corp have a
power comparable to Ares-corp: it does not need a big military force, it can
direct the public opinion and foment rebellions. Obviously it should be not too
explicit to avoid an HR accusation.  Practically it is a scenario of mutually
assured distruction, only mitigated by the HR.

## Situation

You are the member of a small detective agency. You mainly works for common
people looking for some form of justice, but occasionally a small corportaion
give you some more important jobs. Sometimese the Vulcano corp itself turned to
you.

Now, "More important" job is just how the people identify it. For sure they are
better paied, but for your agency the common people issues are more important. Yes
you are ones of the few that still looks for a better socity. You are not
naive, you know you can not do almost nothing against a corporation, but the time
spent doing the good seems better spend to you. You accept jobs from corporation
only to the extent that it allows you to run the business. Common people do not
pay very much.

The contact that normally bring you jobs from Vulcano, just proposed you an
interesting one, saing it is from anonymous committend. From some month,
cybernectical implants all around the city, due to some sort of virus, start to
grow like a cancer, killing the host. The committer said a contact has an hard
drive with the proof that such virus was developed in the labs of a big
corporation

All these smells like corps-war, you strongly suspect that the committent is
Vulcano corp, and also the contact probalby is a memeber of some other agency
hired by them. All probably is a long chain of external agency that Vulcano set
up to hide its involvement. However the possibility of hit a megacorp so hard
is too tempting to you. So you just accepted the job.

Then your contact gives you the bad news: the guy that has the hard drive became
reluctant to give it away. Probably he is trying to get more money than was
agreed. But the good news is that you know very well him: is a one-man agency
whith which you collaborated some time.

You know where to find him: there is a big event at the clandestine gambling den in
the Larry discos, and you know he will never miss it. You go to the disco, and
there is the usual big guy protecting the back locals. Normally you have various
argumentation to convince him to let you in, but this time, he has the order
to absolutely let no one go inside.

What do you do?

## Other stuff

TODO: Describe about Babylon: production; pollution; black market; the sprawl;
powerful criminal organizations; Common and high tecnology items;
characteristic places; architecture made of concrete/steel/whatelse; wide
animals outside?

TODO: Describe the memeber of the detective agency in the "Situation"

TODO: Describe the first NPCs of the situation: the guy with the harddrive, the
big guys at the entrance, and the contact that give you the jobs (to which you
have to give the harddrive)

TODO: add common thematic list

TODO: add an object/tecnology list

bla bla

The scenarist shoudl follow these additional agendas and principes

bla bla
Build a bigger world through play ???
Sometimes, reflect a question back upon the protagonist ???
Look at your NPCs and ideas through crosshairs ???
Give to every character the chance to shine ??
bla bla

TODO : add the previous priciples to the default ones ?

Do not follow the setting creation phase. Use the following themes to be
avoide, and thruth about the world.

bla bla

Here there are a list of trait. You can stil create new by your
own, but if you choose the ones from the list you do not need to ask to anyone
if they are good.

bla bla

Here there are a list of common harm and suggestion of when using them and how
to heal them

bla bla

All the protagonists have the following additional moves:

__Feed yourself__ when the character consumes a ration of food and drink,
you can delete up to 2 harm "Hungry". If you do not have such harm, you
can record "Fed" in the character sheet. If you already have "Fed", you
do nothing.

__Body need__ when is the keeping time, the scenarist __Assign a harm__
"Hungry" with value 2 to all the character. The hungry harm affects ALL your
rolls. If a character has a "Fed" status, do not assign the harm, and just
delete "fed" from the character sheet. The keeping time is the moment in the
day where most of the peoples and animals sleeps. In the real world it would be
between 3:00 or 4:00 AM.

__KO__ when the sum of your harms is 9 or more, you are knoked out. You can no
more act as the character until someone heal one or more of your harm, bringing
the sum under 9. The scenarist __Assign a harm__ "Give help" of value 2 to all
the other protagonists. This represents the needs to transport the body of the
friend, or the emotive harm if they are away from it. It affects all the rolls.
This harm can be deleted only when the friend is healed, or if eir protagonist
decides that the character die.

bla bla

Here a list of moves that the protagonist may select when evolving the character. They
do not need to be approved by the scenarist, unsless when they require some
customization.

bla bla
(some are just Additional questions to be asked in the move that resquestes them)
bla bla

bla bla

Here there is an initial situation, with already created character, with
relation and an initiali goal (it may be ignored as soon as you found new
ones).  This theorically let's you to start playing fully skipping the Scenario
creation pahse, however, consider at least to delete some or all the traits and
replace them with the one you prefer (following the standard rule of createion)

bla bla

Finally there are some example situation that the scenarist may use if ey does
not have better ideas, or just to get the sense of the setting
