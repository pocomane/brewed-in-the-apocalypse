# Brewed in the Apocalypse - Strong

This is a role playing game for 3-6 persons. One person will be called
"Scenarist", while the others will be called "Players".

__Setup__ The players write 8 traits and a name for their characters on a
sheet, keeping some space for harms and anything else the scenarist will
require.

__Traits__ A trait is one or few words that describe a quality, an ability, or
a tendency of a character.  The traits will give to the player a mechanical
bonus to any roll when acting according to them. They should describe the
character in the fiction too, but the player is free to ignore some of them
when acting according to others. 

When adding a trait: it must conceptually be linked to 2 previous ones (skip
for the first 4 traits); the same trait can not be repeated for the same
character; a trait must be deleted when there are more than 16.

__Harms__ An harm is one or few words that represent physical injuries, mental
stress, or any other negative condition that makes sense for the ambientation.
The harm may affect the character rolls, and should cause effects in the
fiction too.  An harm repeated multiple times will affect it more; feel free to
use a number instead of rewriting the same harm multiple time.

As part of the complication or the trouble that may follow a roll, the
scenarist may assign an harm to the character.  When the players do in the
fiction something that can cure an harm, a single harm can be deleted.
A roll may be needed for this.

__Items, abilities, etc__ During the game the scenarist can require to write
other things on the character sheet. If the scenarist does not give them any
explicit mechanics they act only in fiction. In any case the scenarist can
consider them to decide if a roll is needed, and what the consequences of the
roll are.

__Playing the game__ The scenarist will describe a scene, the players will say
how their characters act. The scenarist will also tell how the rest of the world
react to the character actions.

When the characters do something risky or that has uncertain consequences, the
scenarist will ask the player to roll. The scenarist should avoid a roll if the
chances of failing or succeeding are too small, or if the consequences of
failing are not interesting.

To handle the difficulty of an action, the scenarist can split it in multiple
rolls, justifying it in the fiction. The scenarist can also make clear that due
to the danger of the situation, the consequences will be very heavy. Multiple
harms are possible.

__Experience__ When something important happens in the fiction, the scenarist
will ask to all the players do add a new trait to the character.

__Roll__ When a roll is needed, the scenarist decides which harms of the
character are relevant while the player selects the relevant traits.  Then the
player rolls 2 standard 6-side dices and calculates. The outcome is determinated
by the dice value sum + number of traits - harm value sum:

- 8 or less is a failure, the scenarist will tell about the failure and how it
  generates a new trouble that is irrevocable i.e. the player can not avoid it
  reacting in any way.
- 9-10-11 is a weak result, the scenarist may decide to let the character fail
  but giving some compensation, or to let they succeed with a complication that
  the players can react to.
- 12 or more is a full success, the scenarist will tell how the character
  reached the goal; if applicable something good may happen too e.g. an object is
  discovered, new information is collected, etc.

__Death__ Optionally, during the setup, decide a value for the sum of the
harms, e.g. 8, that will trigger the character death. A player can always
create a new character starting with the same number of traits of the others.
