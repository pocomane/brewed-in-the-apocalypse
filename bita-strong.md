# Brewed in the Apocalypse - Strong

This is a role playing game for 3-6 persons. One person will be called
"Scenarist" describing the scenes and what happen in the world, while the
others will be called "Protagonists" and will control a fictional character. The
other characters in the story, the NPCs, will be controlled by the scenarist.

To make the text more clear, we will use "She" for the scenarist, and "He" for a
protagonist.

__Setup__ The protagonists write on their character sheet, 8 traits and the
character name, keeping some space for harms and anything else the scenarist
will require.

__Traits__ A trait is one or few words that describe a quality, an ability, or
a tendency of a character.  The traits will give to the protagonist a mechanical
bonus to any roll when acting according to them. They should describe the
character in the fiction too, but the protagonist is free to ignore some of them
when acting according to others.

When adding a trait: it must be conceptually linked to 2 previous ones (except
for the first 4 traits); a character can not have two equal traits; a trait
must be deleted if there are more than 16.

__Harms__ An harm is one or few words that represent physical injuries, mental
stress, or any other negative condition that makes sense for the setting.
The harm may affect the protagonist rolls, and should cause effects in the
fiction too.  An harm repeated multiple times will affect it more; feel free to
use a number instead of rewriting the same harm multiple time.

__Items, abilities, etc__ During the game the scenarist can require to write
other things on the character sheet. If the scenarist does not give them any
explicit mechanics they act only in fiction. In any case the scenarist will
consider them to decide if something is impossible, if a roll is needed, and
what the consequences of the roll are.

__Playing the game__ Scenarist and protagonists alternate them self in taking moves.
Only what is said inside a move can make the fiction evolve. Each session
starts with a *Describe the scene (move)*. If it is not the first section
what is happened before must be resumed in it. When a move is recalled directly,
its trigger condition must be ignored.

__Describe the scene (move)__ when the session starts, the scenarist will
decide and describe the current scene. Anything she tell can not bring troubles
to the protagonists, neither if completely ignored by them. Occasionally good thing
may happen to them.

__Ask what they do (move)__ every time the scenarist ends speaking, she will
ask to one or multiple protagonist "What do you do?". Then the protagonist will
tell what his PC says, does and feels. If he needs some details in the scene,
he can ask to the scenarist. She will do a new *Describe the scene (move)*
giving such details or just saying "You do not know".

__Rollback (move)__ When the protagonists stopped to talk, the scenarist will
require to return back to critical point in the fiction, if

- She thinks the protagonists misunderstood something in the scene, in such case
  she will describe it better.
- She thinks some other move should be triggered during what they told, in such
  case she will communicate what they have to do.

The scenarist will always give the possibility to act differently from that
point on.

__Face the uncertain (move)__ When a character does something risky or that has
uncertain consequences, and there are no other more specific moves, a roll is
needed.  The scenarist decides which harms of the character are relevant while
the protagonist selects the relevant traits.  Then he rolls 2 standard
6-side dices. The outcome is determined by the dice value sum + number of
traits - number of harms:

- 8 or less is a failure, the scenarist will tell about it, then
  a *The worst happens (move)* is done.
- 9-10-11 is a twist, the scenarist may decide to let the character fail but
  making a *Describe the scene (move)* giving some compensation, or to let
  him succeed and then making a  *Tell imminent troubles (move)*.
- 12 or more is a success, a *Describe the scene (move)* is done that
  describes how the goal is reached; if applicable something good may happen
  too: object discovered, new information collected, etc.

The scenarist should avoid a roll if the chances of failing or succeeding are
too small, or if the consequences of failing are not interesting. In such case
she decides the more appropriate outcome.

When this move is recalled by other ones, they will provide also an outcome
list to be used instead of the previous one.

__Difficulty of an action__ To handle the difficulty of an action, the
scenarist can split it in multiple rolls, justifying it in the fiction. She can
also make clear that due to the danger of the situation, the consequences will
be very heavy, like possible multiple harms.

__Tell imminent troubles (move)__ when the scenarist asked to all the
protagonists in the scene what they do, and if they stop after a while without
triggering any move, she will add to the scene something that give them new
things to react to.  She can introduce such elements playing as an NPC. She may
decide to substitute this move with a *Describe the scene (move)*.

__The worst happens (move)__ When a protagonist got a failure in a roll, or when in
the scene there is an open question not handled by them for too much,
the scenarist will make the situation evolves in a new trouble that they can
not avoid reacting in any way. She may also invent and assign an harm to a
character when appropriate. She may decide to substitute this mov with
a *Tell imminent troubles (move)*.

__Remove an harm__ When the protagonists do in the fiction something that can cure
an harm, a single harm can be deleted.  A roll may be needed for this. bla bla

__Advantage/Disadvantage (move)__ when a character is doing something to make a
future action that requires a roll more simple/difficult or probable/improbable
to succeed, the player will explicitly said what action or kind of actions the
character is trying to affecting, then a *Face the uncertain (move)* is done:

- On Fail, a  *The worst happens (move)* is done.
- On Twist, the affected rolls will take a +1 bonus
- On Success, the affected rolls will take a  +2 bonus

The scenarist will said which rolls will be affected and when the bonus will
end. This move can act as an opposition roll.

__Experience__ When something important happens in the fiction, the scenarist
will ask to all the protagonists do add a new trait to their character sheet.
The trait is selected by each protagonist, but if it is completely new, all the
people at the table should agree on using it.

__Death__ Optionally, during the setup, a value for the sum of the harms, e.g.
8, can be decided. It will trigger the character death. A protagonist can
always create a new character starting with the same number of traits of the
others.

# Lady Whitehorse

__Steampunk__ No magic, psychic or divine. No big Nations or regime. No sentient
android. Until now, there is no vehicle, flying too, that is faster then a
steam train.

- Mostly medieval, with steam-powered mechanics.
- The steam is enclosed in sperichal container: one of a soccer ball size may
  power a motocycle-like vehicles for about four hour.
- Portable weapons are based on the charginginf of elastic elements. The steam
  is used only for automatically reload. For example a small crossbow can automatically
  reload ten dart, one every 5 seconds. Bigger weapon can use the steam to directly
  shoot the proietile.
- Mechanical limb are possible, the steam sphere is normally carried like a
  backpack. The army have access to Mechas.

That is all: discover and invent the rest during the game!

__Harms examples__ hand wound (shoulder, legs, etc), mental stress, low
concentration, manageability, easily recognizable, cumbersome mechanics,
imprecision due to mechanical defect.

__Characters__

- Celeste Whitehorse is the heir of the Whitehorse reign. She carries few golden
  coins and a ring that can prove her identity. Initial traits: Noble,
  Deception, Silent movements, Fencing, Hide, Dance, Command-inclined, Charm.
- Kate Church was the head of the royal guard, now Celeste's bodyguard. She has a
  mechanical arm. Normally she uses the steam sphere as a armor shoulder, but
  currently she is disguising it as an hump. Initial traits: Living Weapon,
  tactical assessing, Steal, Stealth, Long resistance, Fast, Brutal, Restrain.
- Ed Clockside is a steam engineer, and Celeste's childhood friend. He carries a

__Story so far__ A coup in the Whitehorse reign led to the death of almost all
the Whitehorse family.  Celeste helped by Kate and Ed, managed to escape that
fate. They are now trying to reach the near reign of Arkham, where Celeste
knows an high member of the aristocracy.

The first scene is on a train that connects the two reign. They are all in
disguise.  The train is stopped in the middle of the travel by the New
Whitehorse Army. For sure Celeste is on their list. Two guards enter in the
train car where all the PCs are now, making controls. The rest of the army unit
waits outside the train.
