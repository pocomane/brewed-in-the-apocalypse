# Brewed in the Apocalypse - Strong

This is a role playing game for 3-6 persons. One person will be called
"Scenarist" describing the scenes and what happen in the world, while the
others will be called "Protagonists" and will control a fictional character. The
other characters in the story, the NPCs, will be controlled by the scenarist.

For clearness we will use "She" for the scenarist and "He" for a protagonist.

__Setup__ The players together select a scenario. Each protagonist selects a
different character and copy name, traits, abilities, etc on the character sheet.
New characters may be created from scratch using 8 times the *Experience
(move)*.  To invent a new scenario the player should keep the structure of the
example ones.

__Traits__ A trait is one or few words that describe a quality, an ability, or
a tendency of a character.  The traits will give to the protagonist a mechanical
bonus to any roll when acting according to them. They should describe the
character in the fiction too, but the protagonist is free to ignore some of them
when acting according to others.

When adding a trait: it must be conceptually linked to 2 previous ones (except
for the first 4 traits); a character can not have two equal traits; a trait
must be deleted if there are more than 16.

__Harms__ An harm is one or few words that represent physical injuries, mental
stress, or any other negative condition that makes sense for the setting.
The harm may affect the protagonist rolls, and should cause effects in the
fiction too.  An harm repeated multiple times will affect it more; feel free to
use a number instead of rewriting the same harm multiple time.

__Items, abilities, etc__ During the game the scenarist can require to write
other things on the character sheet. If the scenarist does not give them any
explicit mechanics they act only in fiction. In any case the scenarist will
consider them to decide if something is impossible, if a roll is needed, and
what the consequences of the roll are.

__Playing the game__ Scenarist and protagonists alternate them self in taking moves.
Only what is said inside a move can make the fiction evolve. Each session
starts with a *Describe the scene (move)*. If it is not the first section
what is happened before must be resumed in it. When a move is recalled directly,
its trigger condition must be ignored.

__Describe the scene (move)__ When the session starts, the scenarist will
decide and describe the current scene. Anything she tell can not bring troubles
to the protagonists, neither if completely ignored by them. Occasionally good thing
may happen to them.

__Ask what they do (move)__ When the scenarist ends speaking, she will
ask to one or multiple protagonist "What do you do?". Then the protagonist will
tell what his PC says, does and feels. If he needs some details in the scene,
he can ask to the scenarist. She will do a new *Describe the scene (move)*
giving such details or just saying "You do not know".

__Rollback (move)__ When the protagonists stopped to talk, the scenarist will
require to return back to critical point in the fiction, if

- She thinks the protagonists misunderstood something in the scene, in such case
  she will describe it better.
- She thinks some other move should be triggered during what they told, in such
  case she will communicate what they have to do.

The scenarist will always give the possibility to act differently from that
point on.

__Tell imminent troubles (move)__ When the scenarist asked to all the
protagonists in the scene what they do, and if they stop after a while without
triggering any move, she will add to the scene something that give them new
things to react to.  She can introduce such elements playing as an NPC. She may
decide to substitute this move with a *Describe the scene (move)*.

__The worst happens (move)__ When a question is not handled by the protagonists
for too much time, the scenarist will wait for them to stop to talk, then she
will make the situation evolves in a new trouble that they can not avoid
reacting in any way. She may also invent and assign an harm to a character when
appropriate. She may decide to substitute this move with
a *Tell imminent troubles (move)*.

__Face the uncertain (move)__ When a character does something risky or that has
uncertain consequences, and there are no other more specific moves, a roll is
needed.  The scenarist decides which harms of the character are relevant while
the protagonist selects the relevant traits.  Then he rolls 2 standard
6-side dices. The outcome is determined by the dice value sum + number of
traits - number of harms:

- 8 or less is a failure, the scenarist will tell about it, then
  a *The worst happens (move)* is done.
- 9-10-11 is a twist, the scenarist may decide to let the character fail but
  making a *Describe the scene (move)* giving some compensation, or to let
  him succeed and then making a  *Tell imminent troubles (move)*.
- 12 or more is a success, a *Describe the scene (move)* is done that
  describes how the goal is reached; if applicable something good may happen
  too: object discovered, new information collected, etc.

The scenarist should avoid a roll if the chances of failing or succeeding are
too small, or if the consequences of failing are not interesting. In such case
she decides the more appropriate outcome.

When this move is recalled by other ones, they will provide also an outcome
list to be used instead of the previous one.

__Difficulty of an action__ To handle the difficulty of an action, the
scenarist can split it in multiple rolls, justifying it in the fiction. She can
also make clear that due to the danger of the situation, the consequences will
be very heavy, like possible multiple harms.

__Remove an harm (move)__ When a character does something that can cure one or
more harms, the scenarist will tell which harms can be potentially removed.  If
the player is not satisfy he can tell something else instead.  If he are
satisfied a *Face the uncertain (move)* is done:

- On Success, delete up to 3 related harms.
- On Twist, delete up to 2 related harms.
- On Fail, delete one related harms, then a *Make the worst happen (move)* is done.

Any harm assigned on fail must be a temporary one. A temporary harm is one that
can be healed just by the time passing. The scenarist when assigning any harm can
decide it is temporary and when it will be healed.  The protagonist can always
ask which harm is temporary.

__Advantage/Disadvantage (move)__ When a character is doing something to make a
future action that requires a roll more simple/difficult or probable/improbable
to succeed, the player will explicitly said what action or kind of actions he
is trying to affecting, then a *Face the uncertain (move)* is done:

- On Fail, a  *The worst happens (move)* is done.
- On Twist, the affected rolls will take a +1/-1 modifier.
- On Success, the affected rolls will take a  +2/-2 modifier.

The scenarist will said which rolls will be affected and when the modifier
stops being valid. This move can act as an opposition roll.

__Experience (move)__ When something important happens in the fiction, the scenarist
will ask to all the protagonists do add a new trait to their character sheet.
The trait is selected by each protagonist, but if it is completely new, all the
people at the table should agree on using it.

__Death (move)__ When a character has more than 8 harms, the scenarist will tell
about his death. Optionally this value can be changed during the setup, or this
move can be completely removed, if all agree.

A new character may be always introduced in the game, starting with the same
number of traits of the others.
