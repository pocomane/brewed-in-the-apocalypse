# Brewed in the Apocalypse

Brewed in the Apocalypse is a generic system for tabletop RPG heavily based on
Apocalypse World [^1]. All the text is released under Creative Commons.

The following files are provided:
- [Brewed in the Apocalypse - Strong](bita-strong.md), is a compact version, with
  the core rules that can be printed on a A4 page;
  [here a pdf version](https://github.com/pocomane/brewed-in-the-apocalypse/releases/latest/download/bita-strong.pdf).
- [Brewed in the Apocalypse - Detailed](bita.md), is the complete version, with
  detailed explainations and examples, but the core rules can still be printed
  on a dozen of A4 pages; [here a pdf version](https://github.com/pocomane/brewed-in-the-apocalypse/releases/latest/download/bita.pdf).

# Status

The game is readable and probably playable, but it had very minimal playtest,
with one group of people, and while the rules were still evolving.  Moreover,
the English text needs a full revision.

It would be nice to add some other playbooks to show how much a world may
be customized; some ideas: Small Fantasy, Horses and Guns, Space Frontier.


# Scratchpad

THIS SECTION IS IN A VERY PRELIMINARY STAGE, PROBABLY IT WILL BE REMOVED since
it is a scratchpad for new ideas.

## Adapt the system to your games

The game system is mainly composed of three parts:

- The mechanical rules for resolve the rolls, with traits and harms
- The scenarist moves for handling of the session
- All the other moves

The last one make sense only if both the first two point are used, so it does
not make sense to adapt it to other systems. Maybe you can just take inspiration,
but it strongly depends on what effect you want to achieve, so there are no
hint here.

To use the mechanics with other way of being a GM (the Game Master, that is
what the Scenarist is after all), just ignore anything about the scenarist or
protagonist moves the, GM will tell when make a roll, which traits are
relevant, when delete an harm, etc. according to the target system.

Instead, to use the Scenarist system with other mechanics, map the check in
that system to the three outcome Success, Failure and twist. For example, in a
d20 system you can see a roll equal to the threshold +/- 2 to be a twist,
higher is a Success, lower a failure. The only other thing you have to decide
is what to do instead of giving an harm or a change a tag, but probably your
system still have a way to handle the status changes (that is what the harms
and tags are after all). Just remember that when the scenarist have to change a
tag, ey can also consume or assign new objects to the protagonist, since in the
original game the tags were used to that purpose too.

If you have a critic success or fail system you have to add some Scenarist move
like "On critical success, give award" and "On critical fail, make the __Make
the worst happen__ still worse". Again, this depend too much on the target
game, so no ready recipe here neither.
