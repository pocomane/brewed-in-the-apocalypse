# Brewed in the Apocalypse - Strong

This is a role playing game for 3-6 persons. One person will be called
"Scenarist", while the others will be called "Players".

__Setup__ The players start writing on the character sheet 8 traits.

A trait is a word, or a very small sentence, that describe a quality, an
ability, or a tendency of the character. If the character had more than 16
traits, one must be deleted first.  The new trait that must be linked to other
two already in the character sheet, unless it is one of the first 4 of the
character.  All the trait ever written on a character sheet must be different
each other.

The players write the name of their character on the sheet. They should also
keep some space on the sheet to record objects, notes, and harms assigned by
the scenarist.

__Traits__ The traits describes how the characters can act in the fiction. No
problem in opposit traits: the players can act using one and ignore the other
as they liske. The traits will give the players a mechanical bonus to any roll
when acting according to the traits.

__Harms__ An harm is a word or small sentence that represent physical injuries,
mental stress, or any other negative condition that make sense for the
ambientation.  It should also cause effects in the fiction. Each harm has a
number associated to it, that indicate how much will affect the roll. When it
reach 0, the harm is deleted. The scenarist will say when increment by 1 an
harm of a character, or when assign a new harm starting with value 1.

The harms can be decreased, or removed if reache 0, when something happens in
the fiction that can cure or treat the status associated to the harms.

__Playing the game__ The scenarist will describe a scene, the players will say
as their character acts. The scenarist will also tell how the rest of the world
react to the character action.

When the characters do something risky or that has uncertain consequences, the
scenarist will ask the player to roll. The scenarist can skip this if chance
of failing or succeding are too small, or if the consequences of failing are
not interesting. This is valid also for action that may cure the harms: if they
are very likely to succed, skip the  roll.

__Roll__ When the roll is needed, the scenarist decides which harms of the
character are relevant while the player selects the relevant traits.  Then the
player rolls 2 standard 6-side dices, sums the results, adds the number of
traits and substracts the harms. The result will determinate the outcome of the
action:

- With 12 is a full success, the scenarist will tell how the character reached
  the goal.
- With 9-10-11 is a weak result, the scenarist may decide to let the character
  succeds with a complication, or failing but with some compensation; anything
  bad that the scenarist will say, should leave to the players the time to react.
- With 8 or less is a failure, the scenarist will tell how the character failed,
  and then will something bad happen; what happen should be irrevocable, i.e. the
  player can not avoid it reacting in any way.

As part of the bad things appening in the weak or filure result, the scenarist
may assign or increment and harm to the character.

__Experience__ When something important happen for the fiction, the scenarist
will ask to all the players do add a new trait to the character.

__Item, abilities, etc__ During the game the scenarist may ask to write or modify other
things in the character sheet. If the scenarist do not give them explicit mechanics
they act only in fiction. In any case the scenarsit can consider them whem deciding
if a roll is needed, and to decide the consequences of the roll.

__Handle difficult__ To handle the difficulty of an action, the scenarist can
split it in multiple roll, justifing thin in the fiction. The scenarist can
also make clear that due to the danger fo situation, the consequences will be
very strong.
