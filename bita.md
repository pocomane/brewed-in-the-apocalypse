# Brewed in the Apocalypse

This is a generic system for tabletop role playing games, heroic tales and
fantastic drama. The rules are very light and they are mainly aimed at creating
fiction rather than tactical simulations.

The rules support 3-6 player, one person will play as the "Scenarist", while
the others will play the "Protagonists". A variant for distributed scenarist
responsibility among all the players is present.  To play, you need 2 standard
6-sides dice (2 for each protagonist would be better), some white sheets, a
pencil and eraser (a pencil for each player would be better).

It is strongly inspired by:

- Apocalypse World by D. Vincent Baker and Meguey Baker (2010)
- Not the End by Claudio Pustorino (2020)

This game is written keeping in mind a style of game for the Scenarist very similar
to the Master of Ceremony of the Apocalypse World and derivative games. However
it tries to be more strict with the rules, hoping that no "Guidelines" for the
Scenarist are actually needed. However we have a compendium on it the form of
another text: Brewed in the Apocalypse - Tasty.

In this manual we use the Spivak pronouns ey/em/eir/emself: they work exactly
like it/it/its/itself but refer to a person, without assuming any other
attribute. A more common alternative would be the singular they but we found
that it adds confusion in lot of sentences.

```
In this manual, the paragraphs containing examples are highlighted as this one.

# Setup

Before the first session starts, a scenarist is designed and a setting playbook
is selected all together. It contains the setting, characters and initial
scene of the game, and maybe additional rules. We will call it just "Playbook".
You can use one included in this manual, or an external one.

In the rest we will consider that the players choose a standard playbook, with
all ready to start playing.  If this limitation seem too strong, you can refer
to the "Your World" playbook included with this manual (practically it helps
you to create an original playbook). You can mix it also with other playbook,
e.g. using it only to generate new characters for another selected playbook.

The playbook contains a short description of the setting; the scenarist should
read them to the protagonists.  The setting should have been kept compact by
purpose: the rest should be defined and discovered during the play. However
some setting may have more lore details, presented at the very beginning as
prose paragraphs.

Make sure that all the players, have pencils and some white sheets of paper to
take notes about anything. This is particular important for the scenarist to be
sure to remember how the important things are connected, however these notes
have no effects in the mechanics or the fiction.  The game status that instead
have such effects, is kept in the "Protagonist sheet" managed by each
protagonist.

Then each protagonist will chose one character from the playbook, and they will copy
all the information on their character sheet. Like the setting, the characters
are described by few sentences, to leave the space for the protagonist to add new
details during the game. The playbook contains also the initial goals of the
characters, and a description of the initial scene. This is meant just kickoff
the game, new goals can be selected as soon as the protagonists found something more
interesting.

We will use the term "Protagonist character" or PC for the character
"Controlled" by a protagonist.  Similarly, all the characters in the game that
are not controlled by a protagonist, are called "Non protagonist character" or
NPC. The term s "Controlling player" instead can refer both to a protagonist
when addressed to a PC, or the scenarist when addressed to a NPC.

In the character sheet there are three type of information relevant both for
the fiction and the mechanics; each of them is in the form of one or few words
describing an aspect or a state of the character:

- The Traits (preceded by +) are what the character does well, and gives em a
  mechanical bonus on rolls
- The Harms (preceded by -) are negative status that gives mechanical malus on
  rolls
- The Tags (preceded by #) describes other status that does not have effect on
  rolls effect but should be considered in the fiction, or may have additional
  mechanics as described in the playbook

The symbols before this items are there to quickly distinguish them to other
things  in character sheet that should just be considered a note without any
mechanical or fictional consequence.  It may be useful to separate each kind of
element in a dedicated list but always keep the described symbols.

In the rest of the manual, we can ask to count, add or remove multiple
identical copy of some of that information. This is just to keep simple the
treatment, you are encouraged to indicate multiply identical copy placing a
number near it, increasing and decreasing it as needed.

# Playing the game

The game is like a conversation. As we will see, the protagonists contribute describing what
their PC do, asking questions, and speaking in character, while the scenarist
describes the scene, the actions of the NPC and what is happening in the game
world.  Sometime the rules of the game will prescribes to do something else to
make the story go ahead, like dice roll, or asking questions to the people in
the real world.

We call "Fiction" all what happen in the story, while "Mechanics" are all the
things that the players need to perform in the real world, and that
have some consequences in the fiction.

Sometimes the scenarist will be called to judge if something said by a
protagonist is untrue or unreasonable. To make the decision, all the in-fiction
details about the setting, the character and the situation must be considered.
Someones refer to this saying that such details give a "Fictional positioning"
to the character.

```
Probably to cast fireball you have just to be a Mage.  Or in some setting
being a Mage is not enough: you need a wand too. And if in the previous scene
you did lost it, you can not cast it. These are purely consideration about the
fiction, there is no mechanics, maybe just a note on a sheete to remember that
the wand was lost.
```

To describe the interactions between the players, we use the concept of "Move".
A move has a title written __like this__ and it is just a rule containing a
trigger text and a result text.

The trigger prescribes when the rule will come into play, while the result
defines what the people can than add to the fiction, and what is needed to do
mechanically, if something. One of the possible results is to move the
discussion between the persons around the table.  The players must perform what
the result text demands when it is triggered. They can not decide to skip the
result if triggered, and can not obtain the results until the trigger happened.

A second way any move can be triggered, is if another move explicitely tells
to. In such case the trigger condition of the recalled rule is skipped, but the
result text is executed.  When the trigger text of a move just repeat the title
of a move, this means that the move is not triggered directly be some action in
the fiction, but come into play only when another move explicitly asks for it.

TODO : add the page reference when referring to a move so that the move description
can be quickly found ???

```
As example, let's see this compress version of two moves we will discuss later:

__Make the worst happen (example)__ when the PCs ignore a troubles,
the scenarist makes an __Assign an harm__ move.

__Assign an harm (example)__ when the scenarist have to assign an harm, ey will
decide an injury for a PC, and the protagonist write it on the
character sheet.

"When the PCs ignore a troubles" is the trigger, when this happens in the
fiction, the scenarist may do the rest, i.e. assign an harm.

The latter just says "When you have to assign an harm..." as trigger text, so
it is designed to be called from other moves only.  This trigger text, like any
other when the move is recalled by another one, is ignored: just continue
reading the rest, i.e. an injury is written on the character sheet.
```

The responsibility of check the triggering of a move is of everyone; anyone can
say "You triggered that move"; naturally every player will look more to the
moves that ey can trigger; however, if the protagonists did not know the game
very well, we suggest to the scenarist to pay attention to other moves too
(the scenarist MUST know the game very well in any case).

TODO : return to: It is a scenarist responsibility to check if a move is triggered,
and communicate it to the other protagonist, and to ask for the specific action to be
performed, if any. If a protagonist did not really wanted to trigger the move, the
scenarist should leave to em the opportunity to rollback and to said something
else.

Obviously, the moves did not regulate all the
discussion. If someone want to speak of something outside the fiction, and it
do not annoy anyone at the table, ey can just do it. Also if ey want to give
suggestion on how the fiction should go, ey can do it without having a move to
explicitly allowing it.  Also some information about the fiction the may be
revealed (probably by the scenarist) during this non-regulated discussion.  But
all of this should be considered to be hypothetical until some move makes
them happen or reveal them true in the fiction.

# Discussion move

Here we review the core moves that regulate the discussion; some of them may
seems trivial, but we include them for sake of completeness.  More advanced
moves may contain fiction clues, or some mechanical things to do.  Here, the
first move:

__Describe the scene__ when you, the scenarist, have to start the session, you
can resume the last scene or an older one, or start a completely new one.  You
do it telling some new event in the scene or reveal some new truth about the
world. Nothing should clearly bring to troubles for the PCs, neither if it
is completely ignored by the characters.  However, there may be an opportunity
for the PCs: something that can bring to good things for the PCs if
they handle well the situation.  Occasionally the good things may happen
without any PC action.

TODO : describe what a "Scene" is, what it means it is "Suspended" or "closed" ???

Here the move just said that the scenarist can say anything ey
like about the fiction, until there are no imminent threats for the
PCs. How the discussion is moved to the others? We have the following
scenarist move:

__Ask what they do__ When the scenarist has nothing else to say and ey will ask
to one protagonist in the current scene what ey do next.  Then you,
the questioned protagonist, tell your character actions, what ey
says, feels, etc. You can end in one of the following way

- Ask to the scenarist what happens then; in such case, finally the scenarist
  may decide to let someone else speak.
- Ask to the scenarist to clarify some details in order do decide how to
  continue; ey will do it or if you are not supposed to know, see or
  understand, ey could just said "You do not know"; in any case ey will then
  ask you how you continue.

During the description of what you are doing, If the scenarist explicitly asked
you for some particular detail, first give it in the most concise way you can
found, than you can elaborate it.

TODO : add some indication on how move spotlight between protagonists ?

You can start describing what you do also when the scenarist asks it to a group
your character is member of, no one is still speaking, and you find out
something interesting to tell. You do the same if the scenarist stop speaking
without asking nothing, like the question was implicit; note that there are
almost no issues in keeping "What happens" implicit, but we strongly suggest to
always made "What do you do" explicit.

```
Scenarist: Nick try to leave. What do you do?

Bob: What do you mean with "leave" ?

Scenarist: He tries to escape from the backdoor. What do you do?

Bob: I block him.

Scenarist: How do you do it? I mean, you hold him physically, or you stand in
front of the door, or what else?

Bob: Oh yes, I mean just cutting of his exit, I place myself between him and
the door. What happens?
```

__Rollback__ - When you, the scenarist, think the protagonist should stop telling for any reason,
let em finish instead, or wait that a move is triggered, then, if you still
think it is necessary, rollback to the critical point and explain why you
restart from there. Not interrupting the description let you to fully understand
what the protagonist want to to, and often you will found that there is no
reason to rollback at all.

Typically, you have to make a rollback when:

- during the narration of the protagonist, some reaction of the world should have
  happened; in this case the scenarist can __Tell imminent troubles__.
- the protagonist is telling something impossible.
- the protagonist misunderstood something in the scene.
- the protagonist triggered a move without recognize it, an ey continue to speak
  like the action was a success, but you think this is not the case.
- the protagonist is too vague about the precise actions of the character, and you
  want em to add more details in order to decide which are the consequences and
  if some moves are triggered, as well as to decide which traits/harms/tags are
  involved.
- the protagonist gives a vague description of what is needed by other moves (like the
  __Advantage/Disadvantage__ move), and, again, you need em to add such details.

In case you have to completely delete something the protagonist told (e.g. the first
two previews points), always give em a similar alternative.

The rollback can not go over a previous move: you already had the possibility
to make a rollback exactly when the move was triggered.

You are allowed to interrupt someone when two or more protagonists start to speak
one over another; in such case stop them, summarize the situation so far and
ask to a single protagonist what ey does. You can interrupt a protagonist also if
start to perform a roll and you think it is not necessary, as described in the
ey __Face the uncertain__ move. Finally you can interrupt someone if ey is making
a long description of events that you already know you have to rollback.

In general, the right thing to do is to wait the protagonist to finish talking;
however you are allowed to interrupt em if you make it in order to not waste
the eir time, and if after you explained your reasons you give them the
possibility to continue eir description, if ey want.

TODO : delete the discussion about the interruption? It is just a general good
etiquette to follow when speaking!

TODO : merge with the __Ask what they do__ move ???

```
Scenarist - You managed to enter in the Nick head quarter. You are hidden
behind a pillar. There is a guard doing the patrol, to the other side of the
room there is the only door, clearly locked. What do you do?

Bob - I stunt the guard, then I will use my crowbar to force the door lock, and
I quickly go out closing the door behind me.

Scenarist - Ok, you are trying to quickly go out before someone else come in, I
understand it, but to stunt the guard I think you need to roll. So let's
rollback to that point, can you explain exactly how you try to do it?

Bob - Ok, I wait him to pass my hiding place, then go behind him and hit him
with my crowbar.
```

```
Scenarist - You managed to enter in the Nick head quarter. You are hidden
behind a pillar. There is a guard doing the patrol, to the other side of the
room there is the only door, clearly locked. What do you do?

Bob - I stunt the guard, then I will follow the room perimeter looking for
trap, in the meanwhile, I search for storage box, and...

... after a couple of minutes ...

Bob - ... moreover I will continue to tighten the bandages...

Scenarist - Ok, sorry, I have to stop you. If you want you can continue with
all this description, but I will anticipate you that we have in any case to
rollback to the guard stunting. You need a roll for it, and you did not give us
too much detail to decide which the consequences could be.
```

__Ask to the protagonist__ - when you, the scenarist, need to add something new
in the scene that you did not already planned, ask to one or more protagonist,
and build on there answer in your narration. If you think is appropriate,
you can do it also if you already had planned something and want to mix it
with a clue from the protagonists. The protagonist may always answer with
"I do not know", then you can invent something by yourself.

Ideally, you should continuously asking such questions; about them:

They may be provocative to push a reaction

```
They are after you, do you prepare yourself in some way?
```

They may be informative to get some prompt to elaborate

```
You found a truck, or do you think motorcycles are more appropriate?
```

They may be a direct request to to create a small part of the story or the
world (very appropriate when the character is supposed to know the situation)

```
Bart, you are an ex-soldier, how is this barracks made?
```

They may also be just a way to give color to the situation

```
how your character is dressed?
```

__Interrupt the discussion__ when a player needs to interrupt the in-game discussion
ey can:

- To rise an hand, and the current speaker will try to conclude the narration as
  such as possible.
- To cross the two palms, shaping an X, and the speaker will interrupt anything
  ey is saying as soon as ey see the gesture, without concluding what ey is saying.

Different methods may be used: icons to touch at middle of the table, cards to
be slam on the table, etc; the player agree on the methods at the beginning of the
session.

The player triggering the interruption, will describe his motivations, the mains
being:

- Something external to the game happened and a pause is needed to handle it; in
  such case just decide when to restart and give everyone the time they need.
- The player thinks that what were told is somehow incoherent with the setting,
  the situation, or the tenor of the play.
- The player feels anguish or any other strong feeling ey do not want to in this
  game, for example because the narration is linked to some experience the
  player had in the real life.

If the issue is about the narration (last two cases), the speaker must change
any details ey think is not fundamental to eir narration, if it is enough to
resolve the issue. If this is not possible and the issue regards some
incoherence that the speaker thinks will be automatically resolved in the rest
of the narration, ey can explicitly ask to trust em. If the player refuse, or
if there is no agreement in what is coherent and what not, all the players will
make a vote: do not discuss about it, just vote if the speaker should continue
without modification or not.

For sensitivity issues (last case) do not vote, the speaker should always
accept to change the narration, also if it is a strong change.  Normally, after
a wile all the player will converge to a kind of game that is good for
everyone, and this move will be used rarely. If this does not happen, it may be
an indication of different group of people expecting different things from the
game. In such situation we suggest to have a discussion about it. In the rare
cases where an agreement can not be find there is no bad in deciding to do
something else, and find other groups where to play the specific game they are
searching for.

```
Scenarist - and you found an stall with a seller that has...

Bob shows the palms shaping an X so the scenarist asks to him what is wrong

Bob - well, a seller in the middle of the forest? It seems unresonable to me,
can you found something better?

Scenarist - probably I can, but I ask you to trust me, there is a reason for this.

Bob - ok, let's continue, now I am courious.

```

```
Scenarist - There are two young boys screaming between the flame...

Bob shows the palms shaping an X so the scenarist asks to him what is wrong

Bob - please, do go in that details with child and fire, I am a fireman and it
is a bit distressing to me.

Scenarist - Sorry, I will remember this in the future. It is for any kind of
person locked in dangerous building, or are just for this specific situation?

Bob - Let's say that if they can not be children, it would be ok.

Scenarist - ok, no issue with this. Let's say that you see two persons in
danger inside the building. What do you do?
```

# World reaction moves

__Tell imminent troubles__ - when you, the scenarist, asked to all the
protagonists with a PC in the scene what they do, and if they stop after a
while without triggering any move, add to the scene something that give to the
PC new things to react to.  You can introduce such elements playing as an NPC.

If you think the situation is already complex, you can do a __Describe the
scene__ move instead.

TODO - is this enough to handle "Make an __Make the worst happen__ when the
protagonists hand you the perfect opportunity on a golden plate." (together with
roll failure) ???

```
Scenarist - you reach the gate, there are three guards watching it, they are
well equipped. What do you do?

The protagonists starts to talk a little, but they do not have any ideas, so they
look at the scenarist

Scenarist - Ok, it is a bit suspicious that you are all there doing nothing, so
one guard leave his position, and slowly approaches to you, looking visibly
concerned.  What do you do?
```

```
The characters are in a bus out of control. They starts to propose each outer
possible things to do, but no one take an action.

Scenarist - Ok, the time is out: the bus go off road. It crash on a wall.
Fortunately it was not so fast, so you did not get serious injuries. But
obviously now you need to find another way to reach your destination.
```

__Make the worst happen__ when the characters ignore a problematic
situation for too much time or when they give you the perfect opportunity, you,
the scenarist, can do one or two from the following list:

- Do an __Assign an harm__ move
- Add something in the scene that fundamentally changes the situation, for the
  worse. What you add must be irrevocable, i.e. the PCs can not avoid it
  reacting in any way, and the new situation should demands new kind of actions
  to the characters. This can be an event, a character, an object, or simply
  new informations.

You should skip the latter when there are already too much problematic events
to handle in the fiction. The consequences of a
previous __Tell imminent troubles__ are a perfect example of "Problematic
situation".

TODO - explain better "too much time" ??? explain better "perfect opportunity" ?

Some clues are in the relative section, if you use them, make them irrevocable.

```
Scenarist - the guard are trying to break the door, soon they will enter, what
do you do?

Alice - I try to bandage the arm wound, using the medical supply we found. Have
I to roll?

Scenarist - no, you are successful, delete the "Arm wound" harm. Bob?

Bob - Well, I actually do not know... I think I will get closer to Alice to help
each other with the guard.

Scenarist - Ok, the guards break the door, and they surround you. Are four of
them. They ask you to surrender and to quietely approach to them to let you get
tied. What do you do?
```

__Change a tag__ - when the status of a character changes in a way that may
affect the mechanics or the fiction in the future, and it is not already
highlighted by a trait or an harm, you, the scenarist, ask to the protagonist to
change a tag on the character sheet.  A tag is one or few words that have
effects in the fiction, and potentially in the mechanics, e.g.:

- A status, ability, skill, vantage, disadvantage, illness, incapacity, etc, that
  does not follow the mechanics of the traits or the harms, but can still
  contribute to the fictional positioning of the character, or may have other
  mechanics described in the playbook.
- An object owned and carried on by the character.
- A knowledge that can be used in specific circumstances by the character.

Changing a tag means adding or removing it, the scenarist decides how the tag
is changed based on what happened in the fiction.

```
Scenarist - The Eleven Sage blesses Anne. Now her can understand and read, but
not speak or write in it, the language of the elves. Alice, write the tag
"Understand elven language" on the character sheet.
```

__Add a trait__ - When it is a calm situation and a quest ended,
or something important for the plot happened, or when a lot of time passed
without this move was triggered, the scenarist may decide that this is a
milestone.

In such case, every protagonist adds in eir character
sheet one or few words that describe a quality, an ability, or a tendency of
the character. If the character had more than 16 traits, one must be deleted
first.  The new trait that must be linked to other two already in the character
sheet, unless it is one of the first 4 of the character.  All the trait
written on a character sheet in a certain moment must be different each other.

The traits will give you a mechanical bonus to any roll when acting according
to the traits. They should also describe how the character acts in the fiction,
however two traits may be quite opposite, resulting in a character acting
against one of them while trying to respect the other.  This is perfectly fine:
the character have multiple faces and did not have to act always at same way.
Note that a trait can generate negative effect in the fiction, but it can never
be used to give a malus during a roll.  Also if it has negative acceptation, it
will enter in play only if it is useful for the goals, otherwise it will be
simply ignored.

```
Scenarist - Ok, Bart you got a success. Not only you manage to hit the man that
killed your family, but due to your rage and brutal behavior, he is thrown down
from the tower. You hear a scream, a thud, and nothing else.  This is an
important step in the story, so all the protagonists can add a trait or a special
move to eir character sheet. Try to make them coherent with how they feels
after this umpteenth murdered.
```

ALL the protagonists add the traits together: it never happens that a
protagonist add a trait and another one does not.

Each protagonist freely select the traits of eir character from the ones in the
playbook, or from the other characters. They can also invent completely new
traits, but in such case all the other players at the table must agree. When
unsure, players should discuss together to make them not too much generic or
specific.  Consider that strong stress in a single trait does not means that it
will give you a strong bonus, just, maybe, that it will be used in a lot of
situations. And a trait that is always used is not fun to play.

If you really want a strong bonus in some areas, consider to put similar traits
that will probably always be used together.

The "link" constrain is here just to write traits that are somehow coherent. It
does not came in play in no way.  The other obvious constraint for any trait is
that it respect the spirit of the setting and the tone of the play.

```
Bob chose the first four traits of his character to be "Smart", "Intelligent"
"Robotics enthusiast" and "Drives anything with an engine".

After the first four traits, Bob want to add "Perfect" likning it with "Smart"
and "Intelligent"

Alice notes that "Perfect" is too much generic, and also if put in play, it
will not means that the character will be perfectly successful. She propose to
change it with "Understand quickly" if he ment it as a boost for the previous
intellectual traits; also because just linking does not have such mechanical
effect.

Bob agrees, and adds "Understand quickly" as a traits linked to "Smart" and
"Intelligent"
```

# The main roll move

This is a central move for the game; you will end triggering it a lot, by itself
or recalled by other moves. Due to its centrality it is explained in detail,
trying to cover all the possible situations.

__Face the uncertain__ - When a PC takes an action that risks failure
or complications and there is no other more specific move that can be triggered
instead, the following steps are performed:

1. Decide if the roll can be skipped.
2. Clearly state the success outcome.
3. Roll the dice with the right modifier.
4. Tell the consequences.

This move represent a character action whose consequences have some degree
of uncertainty. This can be because it may generate complications, or because
it are difficult do accomplish and so may fail.  Let's see the various steps.

```
Alice - Anne will wait that the librarian go away the deck then she will take
the book.

Scenarist - Ok, you need a roll to be sure to not be noticed.

Alice - Yes, I will use the traits Agile and Fast... and I got a success.

Scenarist - Ok, a colleague comes to chat with the librarian, and they slowly
walk to the coffee machine. When they are quite far away, Anne go behind the
deck and take the book without no one noticing her.  Alice, what Anne does
next?
```

Sometimes the uncertain can be ignored, and the step n.1 the scenarist can decide to
skip the rest or part of the move. The most simple reason for this is that an
action is actually simple to accomplish or very likely to be successful
considering fictional positioning.  In this case you can decide it is a success
and jump directly at the step n.4.  Do the same if the consequences of a failure are not
interesting at all. If a protagonist continue to speak assuming that an action
is automatically successful, and the scenarist found that it is appropriate
outcome, the scenarist should skip all the other steps and let the player continue:
normally should be the scenarist to tell how the action was successful (with
a __Describe the scene__, as we will see soon), but in these situations probably the
protagonist already added all what was needed.

```
Bob: Bart takes the glass and drink a sip of water.

The scenarist does not interrupt Bob to said "Yes you got the glass", probably
ey thinks it is simple too.
```

```
Bob: Bart want to get the glass on top shelf, is this __Face the uncertain__? Do
I have to make a check?

Scenarist: No, he is healthy, neither tired, he can not fail!
```

```
Bob - Bart is going to drink the glass of water, but he have a hand wounds; I
have to make a check?

Scenarist: well, also if he fails, I do not see any interesting consequences...
so just continue, Bart is successful.
```

Similarly, if an action is too much likely to fail, the scenarist should just
said it is impossible, and give the player the opportunity to do something
else. If the protagonist insist to do it, just decide it is a failure and jump
at the step n.4.  This "Impossibility" veto must be used judiciously and
sparingly.

```
Alice: Anne is angry, she want to break the wall with a punch. I use the
traits: Big, strong...

Scenarist: Wait, I do not think that's possible in this setting, Anne is
not a superhero. But she could instead kick at the door. She has good chances to
break it.

Alice: No, she is too angry to think, so she will punch the wall in any case!

Scenarist: Ok, she fails, and she break her hand, record the harm in the character
sheet please.
```

In the step n.2, the scenarist should ask to the player what exactly want to
archive with eir action, and how exactly ey tries to do it. Normally this step
is superfluous and all is already clear, so it may be skipped. However
sometimes some more detail on the exact action are needed to correctly select
the relevant harms and traits in the next step.  Also an explicit agreement on
the result could be needed, for example, if the action is performed to to
collect information about a situation.  In such case the exact information
should be stated, maybe in form of one or few questions that the scenarist
undertakes to answer.

About this information mechanism, note that sometimes the scenarist already
have some idea about the answer, maybe ey just does not put it in play yet
because ey want to find some other solution. Maybe also the player guessed what
the scenarist think. In such cases this move may be seen as a way to "Force"
the scenarist to take a decision and reveal it. In fact, when the answer has
been given, it become absolutely true in the fiction and the characters will
know the answer.

The scenarist may reject some questions, saying that it is impossible that the
character got such information in that way, maybe because too much specific or
poorly related to the action. In such case the scenarist will say "You can not
know it in that way" in advance, agreeing on a set of question about which ey
can give useful information.

```
Bob - Bart look at the motorcycle to understand its status.

Scenarist - What you exactly want to know?

Bob - I want to know if I can use it to reach the near city. I have still to
find some supply but I hope at least I would have a way to go there. Hum... wait!
Maybe I can also sell some part of it that are not needed for the travel!

Scenarist - Ok, so in case you are successful, I will answer to
"Can I reach the near city with this", "If not, what do I need to repair it?" and
"Are there some part that I can resell" ?

Bob - Yes is perfect to me.
```

The step n.3. it is the core "Roll". The scenarist select the harms that are
the relevant for the situation, and the protagonist the relevant traits.
Then the protagonist rolls 2 standard 6-side dices, sums the results, adds the
number of traits and subtracts the harms.  The result will say which kind of
outcome the character will get:

- With 8 or less  it is a "Failure" outcome.
- With 9-10-11    it is a "Twist" outcome.
- With 12 or more it is a "Success" outcome.

TODO - return to classic ranges ? classically in a Apocalypse World
the three ranges are 6-/7-8-9/10+ but
it has the 5 statistics going from -3 to +3 - The starting sum 3 (in mean) 35%
fal, 22% suc - the improvement let to add till 5 (in mean) 0%fal, 87% succ - in
BITA instead you can not go under 0 traits, there are harms, and normally at beginning
is common to use 1-2-3 traits for all the roll

There are no constraints on which trait the protagonist may select, but after a
success the scenarist may, select one of the used trait.  The protagonist then
must tell how that trait helped em to success. If ey is unable
to do it, the roll became a failure.

TODO : on failure, the protagonist can select an harm and the scenarist show how it
make the action fail ???

Normally, with the 8 initial traits, in every roll you would be able to play 2
or 3 of them, unless the PC is forced to make an action that is completely
out of the character.  4 or more traits are played instead during actions for
which the character have a very good fit. Obviously, in the late game these
number can increase consistently.

```
Bob - Bart look at the motorcycle engine to understand the problem and to fix
it. I will use the traits Intelligent, Smart and Quick understanding, so I have a
bonus of 3

Scenarist - yes, but you have a "Mental stress" harm of 1, so you can add only 2 to
your roll

Bob - Ok. I got 10. So the result is 12, a success.

Scenarist - So Bart quickly understand that the fuel pump was detached, and he
easily put it in place.
```

In the step n.4 the scenarist adds some details that makes the scene
evolve ( the __Make the worst happen__ and __Tell imminent troubles__ moves are
described in other sections):

- On a failure, the scenarist will __Make the worst happen__ .
- On twist, the scenarist selects one item from the twist option list.
- On success, the scenarist will __Describe the scene__ giving to the
  PC what ey wanted by eir action, if the situation is not evolved
  enough, also other opportunities may be added.

When this move is triggered by another one, the latter may provide alternative
outcome texts that may be used instead of the one just shown; the ones in this
section are used as fallback only when missing in the other move. An exception
is the failure outcome, for which BOTH the texts are always performed.

TODO : remove the exception for the failure, and explicitely write in the failure
text of each move that the scenarist will do a __Make the worst happen__ ?

Twist option list:

- The scenarist does __Describe the scene__ , without what the PC
  exactly want, but still something else good, e.g. only part of the goal may be
  reached. When triggered by another move with a failure text, it is executed
  executed before the __Describe the scene__.
- What the success text demands is done, then the scenarist does
  a __Tell imminent troubles__.
- The scenarist asks to the protagonist if it is ok to execute the success
  text, but with a subsequent __Make the worst happen__ ; if the protagonist
  refuse, select another option, from this list. To convince the protagonist,
  more or less details may be reveled about what will happen in the next move.

It is not mandatory that the troubles arise directly from the performed action.
It could often seem natural, and there is nothing bad doing it, but they can be
also completely new things added to the fiction. They may also not involve the
player performing the roll at all, but some other one.

About the information mechanism, the first twist option let the scenarist, for
example, to answer only to some of the question (maybe selected by the
protagonist), or to respond with vague indication instead of clear statements.

```
Scenarist - Bob, you got a twist. Bart quickly understand that the
fuel pump was detached. He can easily put it in place, but since all the part
are still very hot, he will be wounded. You agree, or I will found something else?

Bob - No, Bart already have a lot of harms.

Scenarist - Ok, let's say you are successful anyway. You attach the pump avoiding
the hot parts. But to do it you have to concentrate very much, and you do not
notice a bikers who stopped, and now is just behind you. He places an hand
on your shoulder and turns you toward him, what do you do?
```

```
Bob is using __Help a NPC__ move and got a twist result, but text is missing.
The scenarist decides to select the first item of the twist list of __Face the uncertaing__.
The failure move of __Help a NPC__ just said that the NPC fails in the action. Then
ey __Describe the scene__ telling how the NPC, grateful in any case, gives to
the PC some supplies.
```

Sometimes other moves may seem to be equivalent to __Face the uncertain__, but
the fact that other moves force the scenarist to follow a certain clue is a
core difference.

# Harm moves

__Assign an harm__ - when you, the scenarist, have to assign an harm, chose one or few words
that represent physical injuries, mental stress, or any other negative
condition that make sense for the setting; the target protagonist adds such
harm to eir character sheet.  Obviously the chosen harm must follow by the
fiction, ant they will cause effects in the fiction.

The harms may never be used to give a bonus to an action. If it would help the
PCs to reach their goals, it is simply ignored.

__Remove a temporary harm__ - when enough time is passed for a temporary harm
to be heal, the scenarist will ask to delete it from the character sheet.  Any
harm can be temporary if the scenarist decide it can be healed by its own over
time.  The protagonist can ask in any moment to the scenarist if an harm is
temporary, and if it is time to remove it. If an harm is not temporary, the
next move must be used instead in order to heal it.

__Remove an harm__ - when the PC controlled by you performs some actions that can cure or
treat some status associated to one or more harm, the scenarist will tell you, which harms
can be potentially removed. If you are not satisfy, you can tell some other
action the PC does instead. If you are satisfied, __Face the uncertain__:

- On Success, delete up to 3 related harms
- On Twist, delete up to 2 related harms
- On Fail, delete one related harms

If on Fail you decide to assign another harm, as allowed by the
__Face the uncertain__ move, it must be temporary.

```
Alice - Anne take Bart on her shoulder and tries to reach the back door. What? I
have to roll? Ok, I have 2 relevant traits... and I got a failure!

Scenarist - So you can not reach the door, and you also get a "Shoulder pain".
Sign it on the character sheet.

Alice - Ok, but I think that Anne has demonstrated to all the group that she
care about them; Can I remove the "Betray" harm?

Scenarist - I agree, but it was not a temporary harm, and you are trying to
"Heal" it demostrating you care of Bart. So I think you have to roll and the
only harm that may be healed this way is exactly that "Betray". Do you want to
continue?

Alice - Yes! I have one relevant trait... but I got a twist this time!

Scenarist - Ok, you can heal that harm. Now what do you do?
```

# Represent the difficulty

There is no mechanic way to represent actions that need the same traits to be
accomplished, but have different level of difficulty or risky consequences. In
other world, if the protagonist selects the same traits for two rolls, they have
have the same probability to be successful, and the same probability to
generate complication.

However the scenarist can represent the difficulty of an action at least in two
ways, that may be combined.

When an action is difficult because it can generate serious problems, the
scenarist may just generate more serious consequences. In extreme cases, the
scenarist may point it out to the protagonists, asking if they are sure to
continue, increasing the tension.  If the protagonist agrees and the result is
a failure, the __Make the worst happen__ may be very very hard. Multiple harms,
quests forever closed, etc. Also the twist branch could be very bad.

```
Bob - Bart pulls out the guns to threathen the others, have I to make a roll?

Scenarist - Well, yes, if you want you continue, you will, but are you sure? I
want to be clear, if you
got a failure, I have to be very very bad. I mean, you are in front of a war lord
and two of his trusted henchman, Bart could also die in such situation...

Bob - ok, ok, Bart, already has the hands on the guns, but then he cool down,
make a laugh, and said "Oh, come on guys, we have a deal!"
```

If the action instead is difficult meaning that the chance are very low, but
still the scenarist want to give a possibility to the PC, ey can
point out that the action can not be accomplished by a single roll, but the
protagonist must perform two or more of them. It will be successful only if all
the rolls are successful or twists, and every twist will throw in a cost to
pay.  Just one fail and the whole sequence is a fail.

The chain roll, as anything else, must be justified in the fiction. Often this
means that the scenarist should give a lot of details about the danger of a
situation, so that each step of the chain is there to overcome one danger.  All
the details should be known by the protagonists before they have the chance to
make difficult actions, so the scenarist should continuously add such details
in every situation ey think the risks are high.

TODO : If ey forgot, ey can add it in a second moment, before the roll, giving
to the protagonist the possibility to rollback and do something else. !!! NOTE this may
rollback over other moves!!! It worth ????

Ideally, each step of the chain should also ask the PC for
different action respect the other steps.

```
Alice - Anne tries to blind the dragon with her sword.

Scenarist - You are forgetting the flame and its height. To do it you have first to
go close to him avoiding the flame, than you have to climb on the dragon's back.
Then you have to reach the head without falling down. Than you have to hit
the eye, maybe multiple times. They are at least 4 rolls, if anyone is a
failure you have to restart... and obviously you can get harms, loose weapons,
etc, at every stage. Obviously this is just a suggestion, maybe you can find a
better plan.

Alice - Actually I like it. OK, LET'S START.
```

# Support moves

TODO : add a move to recall memories ?

TODO : make a move to said that the scenarist decide for NPC success/fail ? Or
at least a not in the __Face the uncertain__ ?

__Advantage/Disadvantage__ When the PC controlled by you does something that
may make a future action more simple/difficult or probable/improbable to
succeed, you will explicitly said what action or kind of actions you are
trying to affecting, then __Face the uncertain__:

- On Twist, the rolls made for affected actions will take a +1/-1 modifier.
- On Success, the rolls made for the affected actions will take a  +2/-2 modifier.

To remember the bonus, the scenarist will to add one or two time the same tag
with the __Change a tag__ moves. It will be descriptive of the context of the
rolls to which the modifier applies.  The scenarist will ask to you do delete
the tags added in this way when the modifier can not be applied anymore. If the
tag is very circumscribed in time, you may avoid to write it and just remember
to apply the bonus as needed.

If multiple __Advantage/Disadvantage__ are valid for a certain roll, they are
not summed, but instead only the biggest malus and the biggest bonus are used.

You can use this move to affect your rolls, as well the ones of another
protagonist. Disadvantaging a player that is acting against you is the way to
represent an opposition roll.

```
Alice - Anne tries to go on the roof, to get a better view of the situation. In
this way we can get some advantages on check about shooting, or escaping.

Scenarist - ok, there are enemies keeping the house under control, so make a roll.

Alice - Anne uses the traits "Agile" and "Silent"... and I got a success!

Scenarist - ok, so you reach the root, what the others do?

Alice - Wait... Should I write something like "Sight from the roof 2" on my
character sheet? So we can remember that any action for which it is an advantage
will give me a +2 bonus on the roll!

Scenarist - Yes, you should, and if you want, just do it. But the bonus is
valid only until you are on the roof, so I think we can remember it also
without having to write the tag! I will inform you in any case when the bonus
ends.
```

```
Alice - Anne is not agree, so she tries to establish herself. For safety she tries
first to take the gun from the Bart's holster.

Bob - Well I think Bart will see her coming, so he is ready to hold the gun.

Scenarist - Yes I think too, Bob make a roll to hinder Anne.

Bob - ok, the intelligent, smart, and quick understanding will help Bart to known
beforehand what Alice is doing... and I got a success!

Scenarist - ok, you oppose effectively to Anne, now Alice make a roll with a -2
malus

Alice - ok, I have only one relevant trait... and I got a fail.

Scenarist - Well, so Alice reaches the gun but Bart have a good holding and
pushes her away. Alice does not get hurt but the others did not approve her
behaviour: write on her sheet the harm "Betray"
```

__Help/Hinder a NPC__ - When the PC controlled by you does something that may
help a NPC to accomplish an action, __Face the uncertain__:

- On success, the NPC is-successful/fails.
- On failure, the NPC fails/is-successful.

Only one PC can help/hinder a NPC, but other may help or hinder you.

Notes: normally, the scenarist decides if a NPC fails or is successful in
taking any action; to Help/Hinder a PC, the __Advantage/Disadvantage__ move can
be used.

```
Scenarist - Nick understand what are you doing here, and escape from the front
door, then...

Bob - Wait, Bart was near him, so he put himself in front of the door.

Scenarist - Ok, but Nick is fast, please make a roll

Bob - ok, but I do not have any useful traits, so I will not add any bonus... and
I got a failure!

Scenarist - So Nick successfully escape from the door, and pushes Bart, that fall
down hurting is shoulder on the door frame. Sign "Shoulder pain 1", as harm.
```

__Sway a NPC__ - When the PC controlled by you leverages something to convince
a NPC to do something, you state exactly what you want em to do, you give em a
reason, then __Face the uncertain__:

- On Success, ey will go along with you, unless or until some fact or action
  betrays the reason you gave em.
- On Twist, ey will go along with you, but ey need some concrete assurance,
  corroboration, or evidence first.

This move applies also when you tray to manipulate, bluff, fast-talk, lie or
threaten with the violence someone.

```
Bob - I ask Nick to open the door and let us to enter. Can I roll?

Scenarist - Well, you are not using nothing to sway him. You are just
asking.

Bob - Ok, Bart says "Hey Nick, are you not tired to work for Rick ? Let me enter
I have a job for your, a very interesting one.

Scenarist - ok make a roll

Bob - I use the Intelligent and Smart trait; 6, plus 2, 8 then

Scenarist - Nick says "A job? I am expensive, Bart, too much for you

Bob - Bart opens the carry case, putting all the money in front of the peephole
```

__Sway a PC__ - When the PC controlled by you leverages something to convince
another PC to do something, you state exactly what you want em to do, you give
em a reason, then  __Face the uncertain__:

- On Success the other protagonist have to choose to get a reward and then
  tells how the controlled PC do what you requested, or to refusing to di it
  accepting a penalty.
- On Twist you decided if to offer the reward alone or the penalty alone,
  then the other protagonist chooses what to do

This move applies also when you tray to manipulate, bluff, fast-talk, lie or
threaten with the violence someone. The reward and the penalty are:

- If the other protagonist refuse, the scenarist will __Assign an harm__ to em
- If the other protagonist accept, then ey can __Change a tag__, that will give
  a roll bonus.

The tag will be selected by the scenarist before the protagonist choice. The
tag will be descriptive of the frame in which it is valid, and until in such
frame will give a +2 bonus to any roll of the character. The scenarist will
say when the tag have to be removed.

If other protagonist accepts, ey must go along with you, unless or until some
fact or action betrays the reason you gave em.

TODO : is this move interesting at all? can be removed ? "Convince" a protagonist
should be done in-game; this just adds some incentive/disincentive to it.

```
The situation is the same of the __Sway a NPC__ example, but behind
the doors there is Anne, the Alice's character. After the roll:

Scenarist - Ok, you got a twist from the roll, you can decide one consequence
of the Alice decision.  Harm the "XXX" tag ?

Bob - I will say, that if she agree, she will get the tag.

Scenarist - Ok, Alice what you do?

Alice - Anne opens the door and says "I hope you have something more a vague
promise of a job...
```

__Read a person__ - When the PC controlled by you in a charged situation tries
to get some information from a person,  __Face the uncertain__:

- On Success ask the controlling player 3 question from the list
- On Twist ask the controlling player 1 question from the list
- On Failure ask the controlling player 1 question from the list

Questions about the person (you have to fill the _ before to ask):

- Is your character telling the truth?
- What’s your character really feeling?
- What does your character intend to do
- What does your character wish I’d do?
- How could I get your character to _ ?

__Asses the situation__ - When the PC controlled by you tries to read a charged
situation,  __Face the uncertain__:

- On Success ask to the scenarist 3 questions from the list
- On Twist ask to the scenarist 1 question from the list
- On Failure ask to the scenarist 1 question from the list

Questions about the situation (you have to fill the _ before to ask):

- How could we best end quickly?
- Which enemy is most vulnerable to me?
- Which enemy is the biggest threat?
- What should I be on the lookout for?
- What’s my enemy’s true position?
- Who’s in control here?
- What here I can use to _ ?

An example of these moves are already given in the core mechanics sections.

# Master-less/full variant

TODO : this variant, as it is, was never tested in actual play. TEST IT !

The game can be played without a single scenarist too.  For such
variant, all the players prepare a main character to play during the
game, so all are protagonists. The role of scenarist is temporary taken by one
of them according to the following rules. There is no complex design here, they
try simply to implement the principle of do not let a single player to have a
discussion with emself, acting both like scenarist and protagonist.

When a scenarist is needed (e.g. because required by a protagonist move or
because a scenarist move was triggered directly), the last player that was
speaking as protagonist became the voter, and will ask "Who will be the
scenarist?".

Any player except the voter can say "I will do" and continue as scenarist, just
give to all the time to propose emself, if em want to. In case multiple player
want to be scenarist, the voter will choose who will take the role among the
ones that proposed emself.  If no one propose emself, the voter can freely
choose anyone, also the voter emself can be chosen in this case.

Do not apply these rules too strictly: when multiple players propose them self
as scenarist, or if no one did, make a quickly discussion to decide who will
go. Use the rules as a mean to cut "Not very quick" discussion, but normally,
they will be: "Wait, can I do it instead? I really have a good idea - Oh, ok",
or "No one? Bob I think you could have good ideas. No? Ok, I will try, let's
see what happen!". The scenarist role should be seen as something "Common" to
do, since it really is. In fact the game encourages the scenarist, also in the
common variant, to not prepare a complex story, to follow the flow of the game,
to invent during the session, to "Play to find out what happen".

When choosing who should be the scenarist try to give to everyone the same
chance to play the role; so if a player clearly did not do it very often, try
to favor the latter. When no one propose emself as scenarist, you can instead
favor the one that mostly common takes such role, since ey should be the one
more at ease with such role.

TODO : at the end of the telling the scenarist will say "What do you do?"; how
ey can act again as player? If there is a "What do we do?", how we assure that
the scenarist does not start acting as protagonist just after being scenarist?
Is a rule like "Ey must wait someone else speak first" enough?

You can avoid to change the scenarist every time, implicitly keeping the
last one, until someone else does not explicitly says "I would like become a
scenarist".  But keep in mind:

- The right rules are always the ones shown before, this is just a system to
  speed-up the procedure.
- When the current scenarist want to do anything as eir PC, ey should drop
  the role of scenarist; make exceptions only for very simple action, like
  following the group, or executing a direct command of onother PC.

TODO : is the prevoious long-time scenarist mode truly needed ?

Note: there is no bad if, for example, just two person want to act as scenarist,
and other two only as protagonist. This system is flexible enough to handle any
mix of them.

# Details on the working of the moves

The moves tend to share some details that may be not so obvious, so we explain
them here, instead of disseminate these information in the text.

Until now we saw move with trigger in the real world, but it is very common,
particularly for protagonist moves, to have a move triggered when something
happened in the fiction.

Some moves do not imply the time pass in the fiction. If there are some imminent
deadline, such moves should not be use as justification to let the characters
miss the deadline. If the characters are speaking to each other, deciding what
to do, this may let the time pass.

```
Scenarist - your hat falls down and the rock wall is quickly descending, what
do you do?

Bob - I do not understand, is Bart outside the temple, and is the hat still
inside?

Scenarist - Yes, however the time is over, so the wall closes...

Bob - wait, wait, you were just describing some details, there
was no action involving. The time can not pass!

Scenarist - Yes, sorry, you are right. So, what do you do?
```

In general the protagonists can not repeat the same move again and again searching
for best results. The core check mechanics already discourages this since every
non-optimal result gives the scenarist the chance to add some trouble for the
PC. However the scenarist should clearly state that it would not result in
a new roll, since there is no reason that something different happens. The
scenarist should actually allow another roll only if it is the fiction itself
that demands for a repetitive action.

```
Bob - I failed before, but I want try to sway her again.

Scenarist - There is nothing changed in the situation, she will still refuse,
without a need for a roll.
```

```
Alice - I try to hit him again, I hope to kill him this time

Scenarist - Yes, you already wounded his neck, so if you are successful probably
you will kill him. Make a roll.
```

Some moves makes the protagonists ask questions to the scenarist.

Such moves gives to the protagonists a list of questions to choose from.  If they
ask something not in the list, the scenarist should still give any details the
character can know.  Then the
scenarist should highlight that the question is not one in the list, so the
protagonists can still ask one of them.

Moreover, in such moves, it would be great if the __Make the worst happen__ that
the scenarist will do after a failure roll were liked to the question just
asked.

```
The group is in a wild region, and the scenarist has not decided yet if they
will encounter some beast or a rival faction preparing an ambush. As consequence
of a move, Alice asks:

Alice - How many enemy outposts are there?

Scenarist - None, there are no obstacles to your sight, except some tall grass,
so if there was some outposts you would see them. However this question is not in
the list, I just said what you see, so you can still ask me something in the
list".

Alice - Which is the biggest threat in the area?

Scenarist - There is something moving in the grass, at 20-25 meters. It passes
for one moment in a zone with a more sparse vegetation and your character can
recognize it: is a big feline. It did not mind you, for now...
```

# Your World - Playbook

This is not an actual setting playbook. You can see it more like a
procedure and some adivice to create your own setting. Since it is a bit
articulated, it is organized in sub-section.

THIS PLAYBOOK IS IN A VERY PRELIMINARY STAGE

## Create the Scenario

To create the scenario by you own, take a sheet to record the details about the
abmientation.  First select all togheter an overal setting, like "Stempunk",
"Fantasy", "Contemoporary", "7 seas advetures", etc.  Then by turn each person
at the table writes on the sheet one thing that ey does not want to see in the
play.  Here we are not speaking of vetoing stong themes or similar, but just
personal preferences. You can also discuss on what adding, if changing
something already written, or add more constraints.

By turn a person will ask a question about the world. The other will answer
with a sentence as short as ey can, trying to make it enough different from the
other ones. Then discuss all togheter on each answer, why it is interesting, if
there is some incoherence, etc.  During the discussion an answer may be
modified or expanded, if the proposer agrees.  At the end the person that asked
the question, select an answer, and ey writes it on the setting sheet. The
only constraint is that can not be selected an answer that would make the
setting sheet incoherent.

When you have a dozen of sentence, this phase can be concluded. Them, togheter
with the list of the forbiddend themes, are all what you need to start to play,
the rest of the world will be discovered and defined during the play.

Now you should agree on the tone of the play. There is no mechanical system
here, just try to agree if the tone would be serious, realistic, light-hearted,
dark, funny, crazy, or whatever. To make the thing more clear, the protagonists and
the scenarist may make concrete examples of what can happen, to understand if it
is ok for the others.

After the character creation, the scenarist will explicetely tell that all the
charactes known each other, someone better, someone lower. Moreover all the
character are somehow all togheter, in a travel, living togheter, or something
like that.

After the presentation the scenarist will ask to each character one of the
following question. When all the protagonist answered to one question, the scenarist
will do a second round of question. At end, each protagonist will respond to two
different questions:

- Who of the other character do you better know, and how?
- Who of the other character let you go angry, and why?
- Who you share a secret with, and which one?
- What do you think is the wrost thing in this world?
- What or who you're willing to take risks for?
- Where do you leave at the beginning of the story?

The answer may be also not fully detailed, leving the fully exploration of the
question to the actual game.

The scope of the questions is to define the initial scenario, and hopefully let
the group found the first mission that will kiffoff the game. All the important
aspects emerged dutring the presentation shoud be breiefly recorded on the
relative character sheet

TODO : add a full example of scenario creation ?

## Quick character creation

bla bla

For a quick version, the protagonists can just write on their character sheet
8 traits.  These can be seen as applying 8 times the move __Add a trait__,
refer to the relevant section for details. We suggest to start selecting and
mixing traits from the characters in in the playbook. Or at least use them as
inspiration.

## Creating special moves

Every time you have to __Add a trait__ you can do an __Add a special move__ instead.

TODO : better explain the previous sentence.

TODO : add suggestion from baker patrons blog ?

All the character have the following additional move

__Add a special move__ when you, a protagonist, have to add a special move, choose
a move from the list that the scenarist gives you. one that is not already on your character sheet
and add it to the character sheet.  If the character had more than 6 special
moves, one must be deleted first. The scenarist may ask you to customize the move.

The move list is provided in the playbook, however if the
scenarist or the protagonist want to create completely new ones, they may use the
suggestion in the "Your World" playbook, also if another playbook
was selected. In any case, the move should be created before the session to not
interrupt the game.

bla bla

The scenarist may invent a list of new moves to present to the protagonists when
they decides to __Add a special move__ . When the protagonists become comfortable
with them, the scenarist may start proposing moves that contains small
customization to be made by the protagonists. Finally, the creation of fully new
moves can be left to the advanced protagonists.

In any case Is an scenarist esponsability to balance the new rules so that they
are fun to play, so the final text of each move must be approved by em before a
protagonist could add it to eir character sheet.

In general, once a move is approved, it should became avaiable for any protagonist
to be added to eir sheet. However, exceptionally, when makes sense in the
fiction some move can be made avaiable only to a restrict set of protagonists, but
they all should agree on this before the move is added the very first time to a
character sheet.

The rest of this section contains advices on the move creation, and thing to
be care of. They are not strict rules, since occasionally braking these
guidelines may result in good moves too.

The most simple way to create a new move is just add two or three option to an
already avaiable move. It will pratically replace the old version.

```
__Asses the situation__: when the PC controlledy by you triggers __Asses the situation__ ,
the following options are avaiable too, other than the original ones:

- What here is the greatest/least _ ?
- What here has been hidden or overlooked?
- What is the likely previous/upcoming situation?

You have to fill the _ before writing the moves on the character sheet.
```

The general schema of new moves with rolls is "When [trigger text]
then __Face the uncertain__: on success [succes text]; on twist [compormise
text]; on failure [failure text].". Here there are some consideration about the
various part.

The trigger text should not be too much specific or general, while at least the
success text should give something that the protagonist can not be sure to obtain
in other way. This trasforms the moves into small pushes for the protagonist to
perform certain action (the trigger) in the fiction, in order to get a sort
of known reward (the result texts).

TODO : rewrite the following paragraph

Moreover the result text needs to have creative clue to make the situation
change: a success/twist text that just said "You did it" should be avoid.
The __Tell the consequences__ is a sort of safety net to let the story go on,
but a move that relay on such mechanism only, by itself it is a bad dedigned
move.  In this sense the success text of the basic __Face the uncertain__ move is
exactly what you should NOT do in a good move. That move is like that just
because it needs to be a fallback for cases where not other moves are avaiable.

For the moves that can be customized, or created, on the fly, try to make the
customization derive from the last actions of the character in the fiction.

```
Alice liked the situations where Anne was able to stole things whitout being
noticed, so when asked to __Add a trait__, propose the following
move to the scenarist:

__Steal from a personal area__: when the PC controlled by you ties to steal
something from a personal area of another character,  __Face the uncertain__:

- On success, you take what you want and the scenarist will tell how you
  discovery something important about the person you are robbering.
- On Twist, you did not get what you want, but you still discover
  something important.
```

Two good schemas to follow for the result text, is giving a list of clues to
follow in the fiction, and having the protagonist select a certain number of them.
The scenarist will expand the clues, but ey is constraint to follow them. If
the clues are positive for the protagonists, the success text will let the protagonist
choose more clues than the other outcome. If instead they are negative, the
failure text will require to select the major number of them. A mixed move
may be created, giving two lists, one bad and one good, and letting the protagonist
choosing from one or another based on the kind of result.

```
__Feel the engine__ when the PC controlled by you puts the hand on the chassis of veicle with
the engine powered, __Face the uncertain__: make 2 (on success) or 1 (on twist or
failure) question from the list. The scenarist will respond to them.

- Will this veichle be able to reach _ ?
- Have this veichle chance of go faster than _ ?
- What is a easy way to  sabotage this vehicle ?
- What is the fair value of this vehicle ?
```

Another kind of moves are the ones that in the result text mostly performs
mechanical action like modifing harms, assigning tags, etc. You can create
such moves if you want to easly push the protagonists in acting according to the
trigger. But do not exaggerate with these ones since they will not evolve the
fiction very much, unless you found a good trigger that can feed the story by
itself.

You can directly refers to other moves in the result text; these kind of moves
enstabilishes common ways to perform actions.

```
__Drink blood__ when the PC controlled by you drinks the blood from the veins of a
living person, you can __Remove an harm__ related to a physical wound or
stress.
```

All this means that the characters may ending having different special moves other
than the common ones shared by all of them. This may suggest that having a move
enable somehow the character to perform some action. This is not the case. If a
character may or may not perform an action is prescribed only by their traits,
harms and tags, and from the circumstances in the fiction.  If a character can
do something, when ey do it, the move is triggered.  Different set of moves is
introduced only to differentiate the outcomes per protagonist.

```
Bob - ok in this setting there is a move triggered "When you try to
cast a fireball...", so I try to cast one to hurt the troll, moving the hand in
the air...

Scenarist - No, no wait, the move is there to say what normally happens when
casting a fireball, but you have to be a Red Mage to cast a fireball. You are
an Archer, so if you want you can just throw an arrow...
```

# Future on Earth - Playbook

TODO : finish this playbook (HIGH PRIORITY) THIS IS JUST A RAW DRAFT

Earth 2100, or a similar planet with a similar evolution level. During the 21th
century big companies started having more and more power, ending to engulf the
biggest nations. However they have no interest in manage large portion of the
territory, so they concentrate the population and the production in huge
self-sufficient cities over witch they reign.

The commercial exchanges, and in general people mobing between different
megacities, are present but very reduced. Mainly, each megacity is the world of
the people who live there.  The technology level of the megacities may vary,
but it can be anything from the 2020s on earth, to something with pervasive
connectivity, cyber grafts, and light genetic improvements.

Outside the cities there are small settlements, or wandering group of people,
that practically live in a post-apocalyptic world, with scarcity of resource
and wild threats. The main reason to live here is because the policy of the
near megacities do not let you go in, and you do not have resource to reach
another one that could accept you. Citizens passes from there only during
travels between megacities, or because they have a temporary, probably
criminal, business to handle.

Outside, at most you can found some village that found a way to have
electricity, but any more advanced technology is stolen from some megacity and
probably will bring problems. Termomechanical vehicles are present, and may be
properly maintained, but the fuel must be obtained somehow from the megacities.
Very far from any megacities there are some isolated settlement that does not
known there are other people on the earth.

One of the biggest megacities is Babylon, with about 30M citizen and 15k
kilometers square. Since its a very high population density, the people lives
in lot of skyscraper, with the highest floors linked with small suspension bridges.
Most of the bridges are connected each other, forming a metropolitan web,
suspended in the void.

The city is governed by a board of three corporations. Vulcan-corp is sensible
smaller than the others, and do not have the dominance in any field; it tries
to do a bit of all, and this let it to pervade the city. Ares-corp and
Hermes-corp are more or less similar in size, but they mostly have the monopoly
in one field, and do near nothing about the rest: Ares-corp handle the security
in all the city, and have a strong military force; Hermes-corp control all the
communications and information. The other corporation are also smaller than
Vulcano-cop, and can have some influence on some specific political aspect, but
the have always to be supported by a member of the board.

The dispute between the three main megacorp are handled without any violence,
by bargaining, since any member of the board could report any incorrect
behavior to HR, High Referee, an AI the sole scope is to referee such
contention. It may block the resource of any of the parties, if it deems it
right and necessary. This is one of the requisite to become part of the board:
provide HR with the codes that give it that power.

The middle class in Babylon have a supervision job in the production or the
administration of the smaller departments of a corporation. The one with
technical skills may be able to work in the R&D department of them. However the
most of the people lives by gimmicks, probably illegal. The only legal job for
such people would be as worker in a production plant, for that few things that
still are not doable automatically by the machines. The high rank of the
corporation lives in luxury and only care about how gain more power.

The main entertainment form, both for criminals or ordinary people, are leisure
venues, that normally offers music, alcohols and drugs.

The criminality is widespread, and tolerated by the corporations until it does
not produces loss to them. The courts and prisons are there just to give an
appearance of security to the peoples, and to punish the enemies of the
corporations, obviously. The corporation would not hesitate to hire a criminal
if they found it would be useful to their goals. Or doing criminal act by them
own, whitout annoy the memebers of the board. The bast way to retaliate for
some wrong, is pay an agency, criminal or legal, (or a megacorp dirctly if you
have enough money) to handle the situation.

The corporation in the security field, mostly provides military forces, and
some system of judgment and punishment (in agreement with all the other in the
field) but for detective jobs they prefers to relay on external agency. The
smaller detective agencies offers service to the ordinary people too, and a job
from a megacorp is a coveted one. The agency must be registered to some
megacorp to have more freedom of action and to have the possibility to deliver
evidence and criminals to them.

The social situation is very tense. There are very frequent riots against
megacorp or their specific activities. This is also why the Hermes-corp have a
power comparable to Ares-corp: it does not need a big military force, it can
direct the public opinion and foment rebellions. Obviously it should be not too
explicit to avoid an HR accusation.  Practically it is a scenario of mutually
assured distruction, only mitigated by the HR.

## Situation

You are the member of a small detective agency. You mainly works for common
people looking for some form of justice, but occasionally a small corportaion
give you some more important jobs. Sometimese the Vulcano corp itself turned to
you.

Now, "More important" job is just how the people identify it. For sure they are
better paied, but for your agency the common people issues are more important. Yes
you are ones of the few that still looks for a better socity. You are not
naive, you know you can not do almost nothing against a corporation, but the time
spent doing the good seems better spend to you. You accept jobs from corporation
only to the extent that it allows you to run the business. Common people do not
pay very much.

The contact that normally bring you jobs from Vulcano, just proposed you an
interesting one, saing it is from anonymous committend. From some month,
cybernectical implants all around the city, due to some sort of virus, start to
grow like a cancer, killing the host. The committer said a contact has an hard
drive with the proof that such virus was developed in the labs of a big
corporation

All these smells like corps-war, you strongly suspect that the committent is
Vulcano corp, and also the contact probalby is a memeber of some other agency
hired by them. All probably is a long chain of external agency that Vulcano set
up to hide its involvement. However the possibility of hit a megacorp so hard
is too tempting to you. So you just accepted the job.

Then your contact gives you the bad news: the guy that has the hard drive became
reluctant to give it away. Probably he is trying to get more money than was
agreed. But the good news is that you know very well him: is a one-man agency
whith which you collaborated some time.

You know where to find him: there is a big event at the clandestine gambling den in
the Larry discos, and you know he will never miss it. You go to the disco, and
there is the usual big guy protecting the back locals. Normally you have various
argumentation to convince him to let you in, but this time, he has the order
to absolutely let no one go inside.

What do you do?

TODO: add common thematic list

TODO: add an object/tecnology list

bla bla

The scenarist shoudl follow these additional agendas and principes

bla bla
Build a bigger world through play ???
Sometimes, reflect a question back upon the protagonist ???
Look at your NPCs and ideas through crosshairs ???
Give to every character the chance to shine ??
bla bla

TODO : add the previous priciples to the default ones ?

Do not follow the setting creation phase. Use the following themes to be
avoide, and thruth about the world.

bla bla

Here there are a list of trait. You can stil create new by your
own, but if you choose the ones from the list you do not need to ask to anyone
if they are good.

bla bla

Here there are a list of common harm and suggestion of when using them and how
to heal them

bla bla

All the protagonists have the following additional moves:

__Feed yourself__ when the PC controlled by you consumes a ration of food and drink,
you can delete up to 2 harm "Hungry". If you do not have such harm, you
can record "Fed" in the character sheet. If you already have "Fed", you
do nothing.

__Body need__ when is the keeping time, you, the scenarist, __Assign a harm__
"Hungry" two times to all the character. The hungry harm affects ALL the rolls
of the PC. If a PC has a "Fed" status, do not assign the harm, and just
delete the "fed" tag. The keeping time is the moment in the
day where most of the peoples and animals sleeps. In the real world it would be
between 3:00 or 4:00 AM.

__KO__ when the sum of all harms of the PC controlled by you is 9 or more, the PC is knoked out. You can no
more act as the PC until someone heal one or more of your harm, bringing
the sum under 9. The scenarist __Assign a harm__ "Give help" of value 2 to all
the other protagonists. This represents the needs to transport the body of the
friend, or the emotive harm if they are away from it. It affects all the rolls.
This harm can be deleted only when the friend is healed, or if eir protagonist
decides that the PC dies.

bla bla

Here a list of moves that the protagonist may select when evolving the character. They
do not need to be approved by the scenarist, unsless when they require some
customization.

bla bla
(some are just Additional questions to be asked in the move that resquestes them)
bla bla

bla bla

Here there is an initial situation, with already created character, with
relation and an initiali goal (it may be ignored as soon as you found new
ones).  This theorically let's you to start playing fully skipping the Scenario
creation pahse, however, consider at least to delete some or all the traits and
replace them with the one you prefer (following the standard rule of createion)

bla bla

Finally there are some example situation that the scenarist may use if ey does
not have better ideas, or just to get the sense of the setting
