# Brewed in the Apocalypse

This is a role playing game for 3-6 persons. One person will be called
"Scenarist", while the others will be called "Players".

To play, you need 2 standard 6-sides dice (2 for each player would be better),
some white sheets, a pencil and eraser (a pencil for each player would be
better).

- Fantasy World by Alessandro Piroddi and Luca Maiorani (2023)

TODO list:

- Rewrite the examples addressing the Character, not the Player
- Some ambientation playbook must be added.
- Some examples must be written.
- The content must be made more concise in various point.
- All the english text must be revised.
- The final sections (marked as very preliminary draft) have to be rewritten from
  scratch.

In this manual we use the Spivak pronouns ey/em/eir/emself for genre neutral
third person singular. A more common alternative would be the singular they but
we found that it adds confusion in lot of sentences.

# Setup

Before the first session starts, an ambientation playbook is selected all
together and a scenarist is designed. You can use one of that included in this
manual, or an external one. If you want to create an original ambientation, you
can refer to the "Your World" playbook included with this manual. In the rest
we will consider that the players and the scenarist choose a standard
ambientation playbook.

The playbook contains a short description of the setting, made of few short
sentences about something true in the world. Moreover it contains few themes do
not be included in the scenario. Obviously you can ignore them, but creating
with some constraints is more satisfying, and helps you to better frame the
setting between similar ones.

That is all. The setting is kept compact by purpose: the rest should be defined
and discovered during the play. However some ambientation may have more lore
details, presented at the very beginning as prose paragraphs.  Then each player
takes a sheet to record all what happen to their character, both in fiction and
mechanical.

Then each player will chose one character from the playbook, and they will copy
all the information on their character sheet. Like the setting, the characters
are described by few sentences, to leave the space for the player to add new
details during the game. The playbook contains also the initial goals of the
characters, and a description of the initial scene. This is meant just kickoff
the game, new goals can be selected as soon as the players found something more
interesting.

TODO : add scenarist moves for adding details to the character sheet ?

If all this limitations seem too strong, you can generate new character, using
the relative section of the "Your World" playbook, also if another playbook was
selected. Or for a quick version, the players can just write on their
character sheetS 8 traits and 2 fortune points.  These can be seen as applying
8 times the move __Add a trait__ and 2 times __Add a fortune point__ , refer to
the relevant section for details. We suggest to start selecting and mixing
traits from the characters in in the ambientation playbook. Or at least use them
as inspiration.

TODO : remove the fortune points ?

The player should keep some space on the sheet to record Harm assigned by the
scenarist, object ey will find, future notes, etc. Since the Traits, the Harm and
the Fortune points are the only things having mechanical effect, make clear what
they are in the sheet, for example putting a "+" before Traits, a "-" before
Harms and an underline on the Fortune points.

# Playing the game

The game is like a conversation. The players contribute describing what their
controlled character, the PC, does, asking questions, and speaking in
character. The scenarist describes the scene, the actions of non-playing
characters, the NPC, and what is happening in the game world.  Sometime the
rules of the game will prescribes to do something else to make the story go
ahead, like dice roll, or asking questions to the people in the real world.

We call "Fiction" all what happen in the story, while "Mechanics" are all the
things that players and scenarist need to perform in the real world, and that
have some consequences in the fiction.

Sometimes the scenarist will highlight that something said by a player is
untrue or unreasonable, suggesting alternatives.  The scenarist should consider
all the in-fiction details about the ambientation, the character and the
situation, to decide if something is reasonable or not. Someones refers to this
saying that such details give a "Fictional positioning" to the character.

```
Probably to cast fireball you have just to be a Mage.  Or in some ambientation
being a Mage is not enough: you need a wand too. And if in the previous scene
you did lost it, you can not cast it. These are purely consideration about the
fiction, there is no mechanics, maybe just a note on a sheete to remember that
the wand was lost.
```

To describe the interactions between the people playing to this game, we use
the concept of "Move". A move has a title written __like this__ and can be a
player move or a scenarist move. In any case it is just a rule containing a
trigger text and a result text.

The trigger prescribes when the rule will come into play, while the result
defines what the people can than add to the fiction, and what is needed to do
mechanically, if something. One of the possible results is to move the
discussion between the persons around the table.

The players and the scenarist must perform what the result text demands when it
is triggered. They can not decide to skip the result if triggered, and can not
obtain the results until the trigger happened.

To gain confidence with the move concept, we here review some ones that probably
could be completely omitted as obvious them are. A session itself is started by
the __Describe the scene__ move of the scenarist:

__Describe the scene__ when you have to start the session, you can resume the
last scene or an older one, or start a completely new one.  You do it telling
some new event in the scene or reveal some new truth to the players about the
world. Nothing should clearly bring to troubles for the player, neither if it
is completely ignored by the characters.  However, there may be an opportunity
for the players: something that can bring to good things for the players if
they handle well the situation.  Occasionally the good things may happen
without any player action.

TODO : describe what a "Scene" is, what it means it is "Suspended" or "closed" ???

"When ... session" is the trigger, so the rest, the result text, must be done
at the beginning of a session. Note that since this is a scenarist move, "You"
in the text is the scenarist. Here the move just said that the scenarist can
say anything ey like about the fiction, until there are no imminent threats for
the characters. How the discussion is moved to the players? There are this
other scenarist move:

__Ask what they do__ - when you are speaking and you have nothing to say
anymore, ask to one ore more characters in the current scene what they do next.

So at end of the __Describe the scene__ , when the scenarist has nothing more
to say, just conclude with "What do you do" ? Then here there is the first
player move:

__Tell what the character does__ - when the scenarist asks what your character
does, you tell your character actions, what ey says, feels, etc. You do it also
when the scenarist asks it to a group your character is member of, no one is
still speaking, and you find out something interesting to tell.  If there is
something not clear in scene or that you think is interesting to know about,
ask it to the scenarist.

Here, since it is a player move, "you" just means "the player". So the player
have to reply to the "What do you do" telling the action of eir character. There
is also an option to ask more details, so how you can easily guess now, there
is this other move for the scenarist:

__Describe some details__ when a player asks to you to better describe some
details about the current scene, just do it, unless ey is asking for something
eir character is not supposed to know, see or understand.

Note that when the scenarist ends the __Describe some details__ move, it is
triggered again the __Ask what they do__ , that actually has a special case
exactly for the __Describe some details__ move. This gives you a sense of the
"Snowball" of moves the discussion is made of.

As already said, these are trivial moves, more advanced one may contain fiction
clues, or some mechanical things to to, as we will see. For the moment, Here
some other trivial scenarist moves:

__Ask the player to act in turn__ - when two or more players start to speak
one over another, stop them, summarize the situation and ask to a single player
what ey does.

__Ask how the character does__ - when a player is saying what the character
does, but ey is too vague about the precise actions, ask em, in a kindly way, to
specify better. This action applies also when the statement required by another
move (like the __Taking an advantage__ move) is too vague.

__Make clear how it works__ when it seems that a player misunderstood
something in the scene, kindly remember to em how it works, and what can or can
not be the consequence of eir action.

__Give an alternative__ when you say to a player that something ey want to do
is impossible, or will not work as ey intended, do it kindly and give em a
similar alternative.

TODO : add the page reference when referring to a move so that the move description
can be quickly found ???

To conclude with the obvious things: the moves did not regulate all the
discussion. If someone want to speak of something outside the fiction, and it
do not annoy anyone at the table, ey can just do it. Also if ey want to give
suggestion on how the fiction should go, ey can do it without having a move to
explicitly allowing it.  Also some information about the fiction the may be
revealed (probably by the scenarist) during this non-regulated discussion.  But
all of this should be considered to be hypothetical until some move makes
them happen or reveal them true.

# Hosting the game

The scenarist have a crucial role in the creation of the story, so ey
should follow some sort of guidelines to be sure the experience be somehow
consistent.

The long term goal of the scenarist is in the following Agendas:

- Play to find out what happens.
- Describe a world that make sense.
- Be honest with the players.
- Make the player's character lives not boring.

The first is particular important. Initially the ambietation should be kept
simple by purpose.  More details about the world and the backstory will be
discovered during the play, defined both by scenarist and player actions.  The
preparation of big portions of materials is discouraged.  An interesting prompt
from a player should never be ignored to let the story follow some
predetermined track, unless it is temporary, just to close some matter already
almost done.

Moreover, early in the first session (but for some ambientations these can
extend to the whole game), the scenarist should also juggle two additional,
sometimes conflicting, responsibilities:

- Follow the PCs around, and learn what they are all about.
- Give the player a sense of what the world is like, and how it operates.

During the game, whatever the scenarist said should follow the following
Principles:

- Create interesting dilemmas, not interesting plots.
- Address yourself to the characters, not the player.
- Make your move, but misdirect and never speak its name.
- Name everyone, make everyone human.
- Ask provocative questions and build on the player's answers.
- Respond with challenging circumstances and occasional rewards.
- Do not play against the players.
- Be a fan of the player’ characters.
- Think off screen, too.

TODO : better rephrase the last three, or at least explain them better

The question asked by scenarist to the players may be provocative to push a
reaction (like in "They are after you, do you prepare yourself in some way?"),
or informative to get some prompt to elaborate (like in "You found a truck, or
you would prefer some motorcycles?"), or just to give some color to the
situation (like in "And how your character is dressed").

The moves (both player and scenarist ones) should continually push the game
forward in interesting ways. New opportunities should be added when a player
succeeds in a move, and interesting dilemma should emerge from the trade-offs.

# Common move mechanics

Some moves share common mechanics that would be noisy to explain every times,
so we describe them once here.

It is a scenarist responsibility to check if a move is triggered, and
communicate it to the other player, and to ask for the specific action to be
performed, if any. If a player did not really wanted to trigger the move, the
scenarist should leave to em the opportunity to rollback and to said something
else.

Until now we saw move with trigger in the real world, but it is very common,
particulary for player moves, to have a move triggered when something happened
in the fiction.

As you will see the characters may ending having different special moves other
than the common ones shared by all of them. This may suggest that having a move
enable somehow the character to perform some action. This is not the case. If a
character may or may not perform an action is prescribed only by the fiction.
If a character can do something, when ey do it, the move is triggered.
Different set of moves is introduced only to differentiate the outcomes per
player.

```
Bob - ok in this ambientation there is a move triggered "When you try to
cast a fireball...", so I try to cast one to hurt the troll, moving the hand in
the air...

Scenarist - No, no wait, the move is there to say what normally happens when
casting a fireball, but you have to be a Red Mage to cast a fireball. You are
an Archer, so if you want you can just throw an arrow...
```

If a move says to trigger another move, skip the trigger condition of the new
one, and execute the rest of the text. This is a second way every move can be
triggered.  When the trigger text just repeat the title of a move, this means
that the move is not triggered directly be some action in the fiction, but come
into play only when another move explicitly asks for it.

```
The __Make the worst happen__ says to make an __Assign an harm__. The
latter just says "When you have to assign an harm..." as trigger text, so
it is designed to be called from other moves only.  This trigger text, like any
other that would be in this situation, is ignored. Just continue reading the
rest: ... ask to the target ...
```

Some moves do not imply the time pass in the fiction. If there are some imminent
deadline, such moves should not be use as justification to let the characters
miss the deadline. If the characters are speaking to each other, deciding what
to do, this may let the time pass.

```
Scenarist - your hat falls down and the rock wall is quickly descending, what
do you do?

Bob - I do not understand, is Bart outside the temple, and is the hat still
inside?

Scenarist - Yes, however the time is over, so the wall closes...

Bob - wait, wait, you were just doing a __Describe some details__ move, there
was no action involving. The time can not pass!

Scenarist - Yes, sorry, you are right. So, what do you do?
```

When the player describe the actions of eir character, ey should give as much
clues as ey can on HOW the character perform the action. These details are
needed to decide which move is triggered, which the traits and harms to use,
and they are crucial for the scenarist to tell the outcomes. If the action is
too vague, the scenarist may ask more details until it is clear the move, and
until ey have some clue to let the story go on.

```
TODO : add an example !
```


In general the players can not repeat the same move again and again searching
for best results. The core check mechanics already discourages this since every
non-optimal result gives the scenarist the chance to add some trouble for the
player. However the scenarist should clearly state that it would not result in
a new roll, since there is no reason that something different happens. The
scenarist should actually allow another roll only if it is the fiction itself
that demands for a repetitive action.

```
Bob - I failed before, but I want try to sway her again.

Scenarist - There is nothing changed in the situation, she will still refuse,
without a need for a roll.
```

```
Alice - I try to hit him again, I hope to kill him this time

Scenarist - Yes, you already wounded his neck, so if you are successful probably
you will kill him. Make a roll.
```

Some moves makes the players ask questions to the scenarist. Sometimes ey
already knows the answer, but ey can always change eir mind. After it is
answered, that become absolutely true in the fiction and the characters will
know the answer.

Such moves gives to the players a list of questions to choose from.  If they
ask something not in the list, the scenarist should still give any details the
character can know, as the __Describe some details__ prescribed.  Then the
scenarist should highlight that the question is not one in the list, so the
players can still ask one of them.

```
The group is in a wild region, and the scenarist has not decided yet if they
will encounter some beast or a rival faction preparing an ambush. As consequence
of a move, Alice asks:

Alice - How many enemy outposts are there?

Scenarist - None, there are no obstacles to your sight, except some tall grass,
so if there was some outposts you would see them. However this question is not in
the list, I just said what you see, so you can still ask me something in the
list".

Alice - Which is the biggest threat in the area?

Scenarist - There is something moving in the grass, at 20-25 meters. It passes
for one moment in a zone with a more sparse vegetation and your character can
recognize it: is a big feline. It did not mind you, for now...
```

Some other moves differs if the target is a PC or an NPC, they are presented as
different moves with PC/NPC in the title.

Finally, a quick note about the items, abilities, etc. . All these, as anything
in the character sheet except Traits, Harm and Fortune points (or other
exceptions described in the chosen ambientation playbook), do not have any
mechanical effect. However the scenarist must consider them when deciding what
the characters can do and which are the consequences of the action.  In the
same way the scenarist may ask to delete or reduce the number of any resource,
when it make sense in the fiction.

```
Bob: Bart shots to Nick.

Scenarist: He can not... look on your character sheet: he does not have a gun
anymore since he loose it in the previous scene. But you have a rusty knife, if
you want you can make a roll to try to wound him with it.

Bob agrees to use the knife, than rolls the dices and got a trade-off.

Scenarist: ok, you hurt him, but since the knife is very rusty it breaks, delete
it from the character sheet.
```

# Handle the uncertain - scenarist move

Most of the move are presented in the relative sections for the scenarist and
the players; however we want discuss in this dedicated section a scenarist move
that is central for all the game.

__Handle the uncertain__ when a player move with the "If you have to roll"
prescription is triggered, you perform the following steps in order:

1. Decide if you can skip the roll.
2. Let the player roll with the right modifier.
3. Wait the player does what the move demands.
4. Tell the consequences.

This kind of moves represent character actions whose consequences have some degree
of uncertainty. This can be because they may generate complications, or because
they are difficult do accomplish and so may fail.  Let's see the various steps.

First, sometimes the uncertain can be ignored, and so you can skip the rest of
the move. The most simple reason for this is that an action is actually simple
to accomplish or very likely to be successful considering fictional
positioning.  In this case you can decide it is a success and skip the second
step.  Do the same if the consequences of a failure are not interesting at all.

```
Bob: Bart want to go upstairs, I have to make a check?

Scenarist: No, he is healthy, neither tired, he can not fail!
```

```
Bob - Bart is going to drink the glass of water, but he have a hand wounds, so I have
to make a check?

Scenarist: well, also if he fails, I do not see any interesting consequences...
so just continue, Bart is successful.
```

Similarly, if an action is too much likely to fail, the scenarist should just
said it is impossible. If the player insist to do it, just said it is a failure
and skip the second step.  This "Impossibility" veto must be used judiciously
and sparingly.

If the player just continues to speak, skipping or performing a roll contrary
to what the scenarist thinks is appropriate, the scenarist can stop the action,
point out what the player should do.


```
Alice: Anne is angry, she want to break the wall with a punch. I use the
traits: Big, strong...

Scenarist: Wait, I do not think that's possible in this ambientation, Anne is
not a superhero. But she could instead kick at the door. She has good chances to
break it.

Alice: No, she is too angry to think, so she will punch the wall in any case!

Scenarist: Ok, she fails, and she break her hand, record the harm in the character
sheet please.
```

If you decide to keep the the second step, it is the core "Roll". You briefly
describes the risks of the situation, and you select the character harms that
are the relevant for the situation.  Then you ask to the player which are the
relevant trait and how many Fortune point to spend, between 0 and 2 .  Then the
player rolls 2 standard 6-side dices, sums the results, adds the number of
traits and fortune points and subtracts the harms.  The result will say which
kind of outcome the character will get:

- With 8 or less  the player get a "Failure" outcome.
- With 9-10-11    the player get a "Trade-off" outcome.
- With 12 or more the player get a "Success" outcome.

TODO - classically in a Apocalypse World the three ranges are 6-/7-8-9/10+ but
it has the 5 statistics going from -3 to +3 - The starting sum 3 (in mean) 35%
fal, 22% suc - the improvement let to add till 5 (in mean) 0%fal, 87% succ - in
BITA instead you can not go under 0 traits, there are harms, and normally at beginning
is common to use 1-2-3 traits for all the roll - TODO - return to classic ranges ?

The only constraint on which trait the player may select, is that ey must be
able to play the scene in a way that makes evident all the chosen ones.
Normally, with the 8 initial traits, in every roll you would be able to play 1
or 2 of them, unless the player is forced to make an action that is completely
out of the character.  4 or more traits are played instead during actions for
which the character have a very good fit. Obviously, in the late game these
number can increase consistently.

In the third step, if the move contains a text for the selected outcome (both
the roll one, or the one forced by the scenarist), it is read and what it
demands is done.  A missing text means that the specific outcome does not
change the situation.

```
Bob - Bart look at the motorcycle engine to understand the problem and to fix
it.

Scenarist - Ok, here the issue is knowing how an engine works to understand,
what do not touch, and what to touch to fix it. Roll for it.

Bob - I will use the traits Intelligent, Smart and Quick understanding, so I have a
bonus of 3

Scenarist - yes, but you have a "Mental stress" harm of 1, so you can add only 2 to
your roll

Bob - Ok. I got 8. So the result is 10.

Scenarist - So Bart quickly understand that the fuel pump was detached, and he
easily put it in place.
```

In the forth and last step, you can add some details that makes the scene
evolve ( the __Make the worst happen__ and __Tell imminent troubles__ moves are
described in the section about the other scenarist moves):

- On success, if no outcome text is present or if the situation is not evolved
  enough, other than giving what the player was trying to obtain, make
  a __Describe the scene__ move with something good for the player.
- On trad-off, if no outcome text is present or if the situation is not evolved
  enough, select one item from the trade-off option list.
- On a failure, after the execution of a failure text if any, always make
  a __Make the worst happen__

Trade-off option list:

- Select the bad outcome, then do a __Describe the scene__ move with something
  good for the player; if not failure text is present, the character simply
  does not get what ey want, but just what was established in the __Describe the scene__ .
- Select the good outcome, then do a __Tell imminent troubles__ targeting the
  character of that player, or a group ey is member of.
- Ask to the player if for em is ok to get a success, but having you making
  a __Make the worst happen__ ; to convince em you can give more or less details
  about what it will happen. If the player refuse, select another option,
  from this list.

```
Scenarist - Bob, you got a trade-off. Bart quickly understand that the
fuel pump was detached. He can easily put it in place, but since all the part
are still very hot, he will be wounded. You agree, or I will found something else?

Bob - No, Bart already have a lot of harms.

Scenarist - Ok, let's say you are successful anyway. You attach the pump avoiding
the hot parts. But to do it you have to concentrate very much, and you do not
notice a motorcyclist who stopped, and now is just behind you. He place an hand
on your shoulder and turns you toward him, what do you do?
```

# Other scenarist moves

__Tell imminent troubles__ - when you asked to all the players in the scene
what they do, and if they stop after a while without triggering any move, add
to the scene something that give to the player new things to react to.  You can
introduce such complication playing as an NPC.

You can use the same clues of the __Make the worst happen__ , but do not make
them irrevocable, leave instead to the players the possibility to react.

 If you think the situation is already complex, you can do a __Describe the
scene__ move instead.

TODO - is this enough to handle "Make an __Make the worst happen__ when the
players hand you the perfect opportunity on a golden plate." (together with
roll failure) ???

```
Scenarist - you reach the gate, there are three guards watching it, they are
well equipped. What do you do?

The players starts to talk a little, but they do not have any ideas, so they
look at the scenarist

Scenarist - Ok, it is a bit suspicious that you are all there doing nothing, so
one guard leave his position, and slowly approaches to you, looking visibly
concerned.  What do you do?
```

```
The characters are in a bus out of control. They starts to propose each outer
possible things to do, but no one take an action.

Scenarist - Ok, the time is out: the bus go off road. It crash on a wall.
Fortunately it was not so fast, so you did not get serious injuries. But
obviously now you need to find another way to reach your destination.
```

__Assign an harm__ - when you have to assign an harm, ask to the target to add
a new harm to the sheet of eir character with value 1, or to increment a
previous harm by 1. Obviously the chosen harm must follow by the fiction.

The harms are words or small sentences that represent physical injuries, mental
stress, or any other negative condition that make sense for the ambientation.
They should also cause effects in the fiction. Each harm has a number associated
to it, from 1 up, that indicate how much will affect the check. When it reach
0, the harm is deleted.

The harms may never be used to give a bonus to an action. If it would help the
players to reach their goals, it is simply ignored.

He harms can be removed when something related happen in the fiction, as
explained in the __Remove an harm__ move.

__Make the worst happen__ when the characters ignore a problematic
situation for too much time or when they give you the perfect opportunity, you
can do one of two from the following list

- Add an __Assign an harm__ move
- Add something in the scene that fundamentally changes the situation, for the
  worse. What you add must be irrevocable, i.e. the player can not avoid it
  reacting in any way, and the new situation should demands new kind of actions
  to the characters.  You can.  You can use the same clues of
  the __Tell imminent troubles__ , but make them irrevocable.

You should skip the latter, only when there are already too much problematic
events to handle in the fiction. The consequences of a
previous __Tell imminent troubles__ are a perfect example of "Problematic
situation".

TODO - explain better "too much time" ??? explain better "perfect opportunity" ?

Here there are some clues:

- Separate them.
- Put them together.
- Capture someone.
- Put someone in a spot or in a high-stakes situation.
- Take away something from them.
- Exploit the bad side of something they have.
- Turn their move back on them.
- Reveal an inconvenient truth
- Give them a difficult decision to make.
- Offer an opportunity, with or without a cost. ???
- Tell them the requirement and the possible consequences, then ask. ???
- Announce in-scene badness. ???
- Announce off-screen badness. ???

```
TODO : add an example
```

__Make the characters evolve__ - When it is a calm situation and a quest ended,
or something important for the plot happened, or when a lot of time passed
without this move was triggered, you ask ALL the player to trigger __Add a trait__
or __Add a special move__ (they individually choose which one). When all
finished, __Describe a scene__ .

```
Scenarist - Ok, Bart you got a success. Not only you manage to hit the man that
killed your family, but due to your rage and brutal behavior, he is thrown down
from the tower. You hear a scream, a thud, and nothing else.  This is an
important step in the story, so all the players can add a trait or a special
move to eir character sheet. Try to make them coherent with how they feels
after this umpteenth murdered.
```

# Player moves

The most basic move that allows interaction is "Taking Action": it is a sort of
fallback for uncertain situations not covered by other moves. Practically you
can play also with this move alone deleting any other one requiring a roll, but
other moves will bring colors to the game.

__Taking Action__ - When you take an action that risks failure or
complications, there is no other more specific move, and you have to roll:
- on success the scenarist will tell how you reach you goals; nothing bad will
  happen, at least for the moment.

```
Alice - Anne will wait that the librarian go away the deck then she will take
the book.

Scenarist - Ok, you need a roll to be sure to not be noticed.

Alice - Yes, I will use the trait Agile and Fast. I got 8 plus 2, then 10.

Scenarist - Ok, a colleague comes to chat with the librarian, and they slowly
walk to the coffee machine. When they are quite far away, Anne go behind the
deck and take the book without no one noticing her.  Alice, what Anne does
next?
```

Normally, the scenarist decides if a NPC fails or is successful in taking any
action. However the players may influence the outcome if the following moves
are triggered.

__Helping NPCs__ - When you help someone and you have to roll:

- On success, that person is successful
- On failure, that person fails. Only one character can help a NPCc, but other
  may help or hinder you

__Hindering NPCs__ - When you hinder someone and you have to roll:

- On success, that person fails
- On failure, that person is successful. Only one character can hinder a NPCc, but
  other may help or hinder you

```
Scenarist - Nick understand what are you doing here, and escape from the front
door, then...

Bob - Wait, Bart was near him, so he put himself in front of the door.

Scenarist - Ok, but Nick is fast, please make a roll

Bob - ok, I got 3, plus... well, nothing, Bart does not have any useful traits.

Scenarist - So Nick successfully escape from the door, and pushes Bart, that fall
down hurting is shoulder on the door frame. Sign "Shoulder pain 1", as harm.
```

__Helping PCs__ - When you help someone and you have to roll. You can not
help someone helping or hindering an PC.  If multiple character are helping,
add only the maximum value.

- On success, add 2 from the next roll of the PCs.
- On trade-off, add 1 from the next roll of the PCs.

__Hindering PCs__ - When you hinder someone and you have to roll:

- On success, subtract 2 from the next roll of the PCs.
- On trade-off, subtract 1 from the next roll of the PCs.
 
The __Hinder PCs__ can be done also when that person is acting against you
directly (this is the way to represent an opposition roll). You can not hinder
someone helping or hindering an PC.  If multiple character are hindering,
subtract only the maximum value.

```
Alice - Anne is not agree, so she tries to establish herself. For safety she tries
first to take the gun from the Bart's holster.

Bob - Well I think Bart will see her coming, so he is ready to hold the gun.

Scenarist - Yes I think too, Bob make a roll to hinder Anne.

Bob - ok, the intelligent, smart, and quick understanding will help Bart to known
beforehand what Alice is doing, so I will add 3. I got 6, plus 3, 9.

Scenarist - ok, you oppose effectively to Anne, now Alice make a roll with a -2
malus

Alice - ok, I have one relevant traits. I got 7, plus one, -2, then 6.

Scenarist - Well, so Alice reaches the gun but Bart have a good holding and
pushes her away. Alice does not get hurt but the others did not approve her
behaviour: write on her sheet Betray 1
```

In the following moves, it would be great if the __Make the worst happen__ that
the scenarist will do after a failure roll were liked to the question just
asked. 

__Read a person__ - When in a charged situation you try to get some
information from a person and you have to roll:

- On Success ask the controlling player 3 question from the list
- On trade-off ask the controlling player 1 question from the list
- On Failure ask the controlling player 1 question from the list

Questions about the person (the player have to fill the _ before to ask):

- Is your character telling the truth? 
- What’s your character really feeling? 
- What does your character intend to do
- What does your character wish I’d do? 
- How could I get your character to _ ?

__Asses the situation__ - When you read a charged situation and you have to roll:

- On Success ask to the scenarist 3 questions from the list
- On trade-off ask to the scenarist 1 question from the list
- On Failure ask to the scenarist 1 question from the list

Questions about the situation (the player have to fill the _ before to ask):

- How could we best end quickly?
- Which enemy is most vulnerable to me? 
- Which enemy is the biggest threat? 
- What should I be on the lookout for? 
- What’s my enemy’s true position? 
- Who’s in control here? 
- What here I can use to _ ?

An example of these moves are already given in the core mechanics sections.

__Sway a NPC__ - When you try to convince someone leveraging something, and you
have to roll, you tell what you want them to do, you give them a reason, then:

- On Success, they’ll go along with you, unless or until some fact or action
  betrays the reason you gave them.
- On trade-off, they’ll go along with you, but they need some concrete
  assurance, corroboration, or evidence first.

This move applies also when you tray to manipulate, bluff, fast-talk, lie or
threaten with the violence someone.

```
Bob - I ask Nick to open the door and let us to enter. Can I roll?

Scenarist - Well, you are not using nothing to sway him. You are just
asking.

Bob - Ok, Bart says "Hey Nick, are you not tired to work for Rick ? Let me enter
I have a job for your, a very interesting one.

Scenarist - ok make a roll

Bob - I use the Intelligent and Smart trait; 6, plus 2, 8 then

Scenarist - Nick says "A job? I am expensive, Bart, too much for you

Bob - Bart opens the carry case, putting all the money in front of the peephole
```

__Sway a PC__ - When you try to convince someone leveraging something, and you
have to roll, you tell what you want them to do, you give them a reason, then:

- On Success the other player have to choose to get a reward and do what you
  want, or get penalty and refusing to do it
- On trade-off you decided if to offer the reward alone or the penalty alone,
  then the other player chooses what to do

This move applies also when you tray to manipulate, bluff, fast-talk, lie or
threaten with the violence someone. The reward and the penalty are:

- If the other player refuse, the scenarist will __Assign an harm__ to em
- If the other player accept, then ey can __Add a fortune point__ two times

```
The situation is the same of the __Sway a NPC__ example, but behind
the doors there is Anne, the Alice's character. After the roll:

Scenarist - Ok, with 8 you can decide one consequence of the Alice decision.
Harm or Fortune points ?

Bob - I will say, that if she agree, she will get two fortune points.

Scenarist - Ok, Alice what you do?

Alice - Anne opens the door and says "I hope you have something more a vague
promise of a job...
```

 __Taking an advantages__ - when you are doing something to make a future
action more simple or probable to succeed, explicitly said what action or kind
of actions you are trying to favor, and you have to roll.
- On Success write a +2 bonus on the character sheet; take also a short note of
  the action or kind of actions you are trying to favor.  If you have to roll
for that action, you can add a +2 to the roll and then delete the bonus.

```
Alice - Anne tries to go on the roof, to get a better view of the situation. In
this way we can get some advantages on check about shooting, or escaping.

Scenarist - ok, there are enemies keeping the house under control, so make a roll.

Alice - Anne uses the traits "Agile" and "Silent", so I got 8 plus 2, 10.

Scenarist - ok, until Alice is on the roof, you all have +2 bonus on every check
that such position may help.
```

__Remove an harm__ - when you make some action that can cure or treat some
status associated to one or more harm and you have to roll:

- On Success, decrease up to 3 times one or more related harms, delete the ones
  that reach 0
- On trade-off, decrease up to 2 times one single related harms, delete it if
  it reaches 0
- On Fail, decrease one related harms, delete it if it reaches 0

```
Alice - Anne take Bart on her shoulder and tries to reach the back door.

Scenarist - ok, make a roll.

Alice - I have 2 relevant traits and I got 3, so I think I can not reach it.

Scenarist - No, and you also get wound, sign it non the sheet.

Alice - Ok, but I think that Anne has demonstrated to all the group that she
care about them; I should remove the "Betray 1" harm.

Scenarist - I fully agree!
```

__Add a special move__ when you have to add a special move, the scenarist will
show you a list of moves. Choose one that is not already on your character sheet
and add it to the character sheet.  If the character had more than 6 special
moves, one must be deleted first. The scenarist may ask you to customize the move.

The move list is provided in the ambientation playbook, however if the
scenarist or the player want to create completely new ones, they may use the
suggestion in the "Your World" ambientation playbook, also if another playbook
was selected.


__Add a fortune point__ - when you have to add a fortune point, increase by
1 the number of fortune point on the character sheet. If you already have
6 fortune points or more, you do not increment it.

The fortune point can be spent to give you a mechanical bonus to your future
rolls.

__Add a trait__ - when you have to add a trait, add into the trait section of
your character sheet a word, or a very small sentence, that describe a
quality, an ability, or a tendency of the character. If the character had more
than 16 traits, one must be deleted first.  The new trait that must be linked
to other two already in the character sheet, unless it is one of the first 4 of
the character.  All the trait ever written on a character sheet must be
different each other.

The traits will give you a mechanical bonus to any roll when acting according
to the traits. They should also describe how the character acts in the fiction,
however two traits may be quite opposite, resulting in a character acting
against one of them while trying to respect the other.  This is perfectly ok:
the character have multiple faces and did not have to act always at same way.
Note that a trait can generate negative effect in the fiction, but it can never
be used to give a malus during a roll.  Also if it has negative acceptation, it
will enter in play only if it is useful for the goals, otherwise it will be
simply ignored.  You can invent completely new traits, just be sure that all
the other persons at the table are agree on using them.

```
Bob chose the first four traits of his character to be "Smart", "Intelligent"
"Robotics enthusiast" and "Drives anything with an engine".
```

Each player freely select the traits of eir character, but we suggest to
discuss with all the others to make them not too much generic or specific.
Moreover consider that strong stress in a single trait does not means that it
will give you a strong bonus, just, maybe, that it will be used in a lot of
situations. And a trait that is always used is not fun to play.

If you really want a strong bonus in some areas, consider to put similar traits
that will probably always be used together.

The "link" constrain is here just to write traits that are somehow coherent. It
does not came in play in no way.  The other obvious constraint for any trait is
that it respect the spirit of the ambientation and the tone of the play.

```
After the first four traits, Bob want to add "Perfect" likning it with "Smart"
and "Intelligent"

Alice notes that "Perfect" is too much generic, and also if put in play, it
will not means that the character will be perfectly successful. She propose to
change it with "Understand quickly" if he ment it as a boost for the previous
intellectual traits; also because just linking does not have such mechanical
effect.

Bob agrees, and adds "Understand quickly" as a traits linked to "Smart" and
"Intelligent"
```

# Represent the difficulty

There is no mechanic way to represent actions that need the same traits to be
accomplished, but have different level of difficulty or risky consequences. In
other world, if the player selects the same traits for two rolls, they have
have the same probability to be successful, and the same probability to
generate complication.

However the scenarist can represent the difficulty of an action at least in two
ways, that may be combined.

When an action is difficult because it can generate serious problems, the
scenarist may just generate more serious consequences. In extreme cases, the
scenarist may point it out to the players, asking if they are sure to continue,
increasing the tension.  If the player agrees and the result is a failure,
the __Make the worst happen__ may be very very hard. Multiple harms, dying,
quests forever closed, etc. Also the trade-off branch could be very bad.

```
Bob - Bart pulls out the guns...

Scenarist - hey, wait wait. If you want you can continue, but I want to be clear,
if you will have to roll for what you are doing (and probably you will), and you
got a failure, I have to be very very bad. I mean, you are in front of a war lord
and two of his trusted henchman, Bart could also die in such situation...

Bob - ok, ok, Bart, already has the hands on the guns, but then he cool down,
make a laugh, and said "Oh, come on guys, we have a deal!"
```

If the action instead is difficult meaning that the chance are very low, but
still the scenarist want to give a possibility to the player, ey can
point out that the action can not be accomplished by a single roll, but the
player must perform two or more of them. It will be successful only if all the
rolls are successful or trade-offs, and every trade-off will throw in a cost to
pay.  Just one fail and the whole sequence is a fail.

The chain roll, as anything else, must be justified in the fiction. Often this
means that the scenarist should give a lot of details about the danger of a
situation, so that each step of the chain is there so overcome one danger.  All
the details should be known by the players before they have the chance to make
difficult actions, so the scenarist should continuously add them in every
situation ey think the risks are high.

Finally, each step of the chain should ask the player for different action
respect the other steps.

```
Alice - Anne tries to blind the dragon with her sword.

Scenarist - You are forgetting the flame and its height. To do it you have first to
go close to him avoiding the flame, than you have to climb on the dragon's back.
Then you have to reach the head without falling down. Than you have to hit
the eye, maybe multiple times. They are at least 4 rolls, if anyone is a
failure you have to restart... and obviously you can get harms, loose weapons,
etc, at every stage. Obviously this is just a suggestion, maybe you can find a
better plan.

Alice - Actually I like it. OK, LET'S START.
```

# Adapt the system to you games

THIS SECTION IS IN A VERY PRELIMINARY STAGE

This game system is mainly composed of two parts:

- The mechanical rules for resolve the rolls, with traits and harms
- The scenarist handling of the session

To use the mechanics with other way of being a GM, a.k.a. Game Master (that is
what the Scenarist is after all), just ignore anything about the moves (both of
the scenarist and the player): the Game Master will tell when make a roll,
which trait to use, when mark an harm, etc.

Instead, to use the Scenarist system with other mechanics, map the check in
that system to the three outcome Success, Failure and Trade-off. For example,
in a d20 system you can see a roll equal to the threshold +/- 1 to be a
trade-off, higher is a Success, lower a failure. The only other thing you have
to decide is what to do instead of giving an harm but probably your system
still have a way to handle the status changes (that is what the harms are after
all).

If you have a critic success or fail system you have to add some Scenarist move
like "On critical success, give award" and "On critical fail, make the __Make
the worst happen__ still worse". There are no ready recipe here.

# Master less or Master full

THIS SECTION IS IN A VERY PRELIMINARY STAGE, AND NEEDS A LOT OF TESTING.

A master less version is being developed. In it there is no a single scenarist,
but eir role is divided by all the player. So probably a better name
would be "Masterfull".

The basic idea is that the scenarist moves are avaiable to all the players, and
when the scenarist should act, the first player that pay a Scenarist Token can
act as the scenarist. The Scenarist Token are collected every time your
character make a roll (a player can have maximum 5 scenarist token).

Note: the reposnability of checking for the move trigger should be changed with
something like the following.  Every player is responsable to check if a player
move is triggered for the controlled character. The scenarist is responsable to
check if a scenarist move is triggered. If someone misses a trigger, any other
person may remember them that there is somehing to do.

# Small Fantasy - Playbook

TODO : make an exampl playbook (HIGH PRIORITY)

All the players have the following additional moves:

__Feed yourself__ when the character consumes a ration of food and drink,
you can delete up to 2 harm "Hungry". If you do not have such harm, you
can record "Fed" in the character sheet. If you already have "Fed", you
do nothing.

__Body need__ when is the keeping time, the scenarist __Assign a harm__
"Hungry" with value 2 to all the character. The hungry harm affects ALL your
rolls. If a character has a "Fed" status, do not assign the harm, and just
delete "fed" from the character sheet. The keeping time is the moment in the
day where most of the peoples and animals sleeps. In the real world it would be
between 3:00 or 4:00 AM.

__KO__ when the sum of your harms is 9 or more, you are knoked out. You can no
more act as the character until someone heal one or more of your harm, bringing
the sum under 9. The scenarist __Assign a harm__ "Give help" of value 2 to all
the other players. This represents the needs to transport the body of the
friend, or the emotive harm if they are away from it. It affects all the rolls.
This harm can be deleted only when the friend is healed, or if eir playerd
decides that the characted die.

# Horses and Guns - Playbook

TODO : make an exampl playbook (HIGH PRIORITY)

# Space Frontier - Playbook

TODO : make an exampl playbook

# Your World - Playbook

This is not an actual ambientation playbook. You can see it more like a
procedure and some adivice to create your own ambientation. Since it is a bit
articulated, it is organized in sub-section.

THIS PLAYBOOK IS IN A VERY PRELIMINARY STAGE

## Create the Scenario

To create the scenario by you own, take a sheet to record the details about the
abmientation.  First select all togheter an overal setting, like "Stempunk",
"Fantasy", "Contemoporary", "7 seas advetures", etc.  Then by turn each person
at the table writes on the sheet one thing that ey does not want to see in the
play.  Here we are not speaking of vetoing stong themes or similar, but just
personal preferences. You can also discuss on what adding, if changing
something already written, or add more constraints.

By turn a person will ask a question about the world. The other will answer
with a sentence as short as ey can, trying to make it enough different from the
other ones. Then discuss all togheter on each answer, why it is interesting, if
there is some incoherence, etc.  During the discussion an answer may be
modified or expanded, if the proposer agrees.  At the end the person that asked
the question, select an answer, and ey writes it on the ambientation sheet. The
only constraint is that can not be selected an answer that would make the
ambientation sheet incoherent.

When you have a dozen of sentence, this phase can be concluded. Them, togheter
with the list of the forbiddend themes, are all what you need to start to play,
the rest of the world will be discovered and defined during the play.

Now you should agree on the tone of the play. There is no mechanical system
here, just try to agree if the tone would be serious, realistic, light-hearted,
dark, funny, crazy, or whatever. To make the thing more clear, the players and
the scenarist may make concrete examples of what can happen, to understand if it
is ok for the others.

After the character creation, the scenarist will explicetely tell that all the
charactes known each other, someone better, someone lower. Moreover all the
character are somehow all togheter, in a travel, living togheter, or something
like that.

After the presentation the scenarist will ask to each character one of the
following question. When all the player answered to one question, the scenarist
will do a second round of question. At end, each player will respond to two
different questions:

- Who of the other character do you better know, and how?
- Who of the other character let you go angry, and why?
- Who you share a secret with, and which one?
- What do you think is the wrost thing in this world?
- What or who you're willing to take risks for?
- Where do you leave at the beginning of the story?

The answer may be also not fully detailed, leving the fully exploration of the
question to the actual game.

The scope of the questions is to define the initial scenario, and hopefully let
the group found the first mission that will kiffoff the game. All the important
aspects emerged dutring the presentation shoud be breiefly recorded on the
relative character sheet

TODO : add a full example of scenario creation ?

## Creating special moves

The scenarist may invent a list of new moves to present to the players when
they decides to __Add a special move__ . When the players become comfortable
with them, the scenarist may start proposing moves that contains small
customization to be made by the players. Finally, the creation of fully new
moves can be left to the advanced players.

In any case Is an scenarist esponsability to balance the new rules so that they
are fun to play, so the final text of each move must be approved by em before a
player could add it to eir character sheet.

In general, once a move is approved, it should became avaiable for any player
to be added to eir sheet. However, exceptionally, when makes sense in the
fiction some move can be made avaiable only to a restrict set of players, but
they all should agree on this before the move is added the very first time to a
character sheet.

The rest of this section contains advices on the move creation, and thing to
be care of. They are not strict rules, since occasionally braking these
guidelines may result in good moves too.

The most simple way to create a new move is just add two or three option to an
already avaiable move. It will pratically replace the old version.

```
__Asses the situation__: when you have to __Asses the situation__ , the following
options are avaiable too, other than the original ones

- What here is the greatest/least _ ?
- What here has been hidden or overlooked?
- What is the likely previous/upcoming situation?
 
The player may fill the _ before writing the moves on the character sheet.
```

The general schema of new moves with rolls is "When [trigger text] then ask to
roll; on success [succes text]; on trade-off [compormise text]; on failure
[failure text].". Here there are some consideration about the various part.

The trigger text should not be too much specific or general, while at least the
success text should give something that the player can not be sure to obtain
in other way. This trasforms the moves into small pushes for the player to
perform certain action (the trigger) in the fiction, in order to get a sort
of known reward (the result texts).

TODO : rewrite the following paragraph

Moreover the result text needs to have creative clue to make the situation
change: a success/trade-off text that just said "You did it" should be avoid.
The __Tell the consequences__ is a sort of safety net to let the story go on,
but a move that relay on such mechanism only, by itself it is a bad dedigned
move.  In this sense the success text of the basic __Taking action__ move is
exactly what you should NOT do in a good move. That move is like that just
because it needs to be a fallback for cases where not other moves are avaiable.

For the moves that can be customized, or created, on the fly, try to make the
customization derive from the last actions of the character in the fiction.

```
Alice liked the situations where Anne was able to stole things whitout being
noticed, so when asked to make the character evolve, propose the following
move to the scenarist:

__Steal from a personal area__: when you are trying to steal something from a
personal area of somebody, and you have to roll:
- On success, you take what you want and the scenarist will tell how you
  discovery something important about the person you are robbering.
- On trade-off, you did not get what you want, but you still discover
  something important.
```

Two good schemas to follow for the result text, is giving a list of clues to
follow in the fiction, and having the player select a certain number of them.
The scenarist will expand the clues, but ey is constraint to follow them. If
the clues are positive for the players, the success text will let the player
choose more clues than the other outcome. If instead they are negative, the
failure text will require to select the major number of them. A mixed move
may be created, giving two lists, one bad and one good, and letting the player
choosing from one or another based on the kind of result.

```
__Feel the engine__ when the character put the hand on the chassis of veicle with
the engine powered, and ey have to roll: 2 (on success) or 1 (on trade-off or
failure) question from the list. The scenarist will respond to them.

- Will this veichle be able to reach _ ?
- Have this veichle chance of go faster than _ ?
- What is a easy way to  sabotage this vehicle ?
- What is the fair value of this vehicle ?
```

Another kind of moves are the ones that in the result text mostly performs
mechanical action like modifing harms, giving fortune point, etc. You can create
such moves if you want to easly push the players in acting according to the
trigger. But do not exaggerate with these ones since they will not evolve the
fiction very much, unless you found a good trigger that can feed the story by
itself.

You can directly refers to other moves in the result text; these kind of moves
enstabilishes common ways to perform actions.

```
__Drink blood__ when you drink the blood from the veins of a living person, you
can __Remove an harm__ related to a physical wound or stress.
```

## Other moves
